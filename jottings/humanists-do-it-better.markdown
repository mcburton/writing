# Humanists do it better:

-DH infrastructure needs those who do DH, not just developers, to build out infrastructure.(Borgman 2009)

- "Because we can make...a better infrastructure, if our perspectives, our training, and our expertise are included in its design and deployment." (Unsworth 2004)

Damon Horowitz tells us "Why you should quit your technology job and get a Ph.D. in the humanities" http://chronicle.com/article/From-Technologist-to/128231/

This trope has recently circulated in the popular sphere in Walter Issaccson's biography of Steve Jobs.
Steve Jobs biography - his humanities training led him to design better technology.



Unsworth briefly chips in his two cents claiming, "[a]fter all, science—whose goal is predictive certainty—only has half the picture. Uncertainty (or ambiguity, if you prefer) is the other half, and the humanities and social sciences celebrate that, explore it, tolerate it, and understand it better than the sciences do. "(Unsworth 2004)


When I learned of the Structure and Operation of a computer in my computer science courses, I bumbled down a narrative-less path of arithmetic logic units (ALUs), Verilog, and the MIC-1 (Tanenbaum 1984 - structured Computer Organization). Note, I am in no way shape or form disparaging my undergraduate experience in computer science. I thoroughly enjoyed learning those subjects (and revisiting them in the course of this writing), however it was very challenging. When a humanist explains how a computer works, they place the artifact within a historical and cultural context. "While popular rhetoric encourages users to imagine digital technologies outside of various histories of technology, of culture and of labor, I argue here that those histories are essential to a proper understanding of how a computer functions." (Laue 2004) 

From the example above, it would seem part of the humanist mystique would be situating knowledge contextually. All objects, artifacts, ideas, and people are part of a interconnected network or web of relations, a network so complex that human beings will never fully "know" it. As humanists start from this base assumption, or some reasonable approximation, they bring a comfortability with uncertainty that seems completely alien (except perhaps quantum physics which might explain they physicists proclivity for becoming bad philosophers). How exactly the humanist epistemology informs the design of technology remains an open question. Any investigation along these lines runs against the issues asking about the "value proposition of the humanities."

These challenges aside, there is still a dire need for further evidence if the claim is true; can humanists do build better technology? What would "it" be about humanities training that leads to better design practice?
