### Grey Literature & the Digital Humanities


For some time now I have been trying to organize my thoughts so that I man contribute to the cacophonous cloud of voices each shouting for a discursive perch in the ongoing debates and discussions in the digital humanities. With this I must preface, anything we may know or think we may know about the digital humanities will certainly change. The pace of these changes, both technological, but also sociological has reached an escape velocity of sorts, away from a grounding in traditional knows of humanist academic practice and into an orbit of new heights. From this point where the digital humanities travels is something we can excitedly watch and see for we all have a ticket to ride.

Here is a bit of an abstract for my final project in this course. I
would like to spend some time fleshing out an idea I have been kicking
around my head for the last few weeks. In the spirit of a doctoral
student I hope to take out two birds with a single stone,  first to
satisfy the requirements of this course, and  second to draft a
chapter for my field prelim. Lets find out if it will work.
By no means problematic, since I have encouraged others to use the course as seed work that situates personal interests in the context of DH. In your case, the proximity is closest of all.



For the last several months I have immersed myself in the literatures
on and of the digital humanities coming to a head with the "mapping
the digital humanities" course. During the course of my review I have
seen two distinct tensions emerge. The first is the ongoing
definitional debate between "humanities computing" and "digital
humanities." I penned a few words about what I thought their
differences in my blog post for week one, I'd like to expand upon that
by bringing in the later readings from the course and my own earlier
readings as well.
When I look at your draft, I'll see if any other sources come to mind, though there are so many and you are bringing some to my attention as well.


To synthesize these literatures and unpack the tension between
humanities computing and digital humanities I have been dwelling upon
a thematic spectrum with "computation" on one end and "communication"
at the other. Curiously, (I think) if I trace the evolution of HC/DH
through time it sets up a trajectory that follows this spectrum quite
nicely. The historical evolution of HC to DH  is strengthened by an
observation by Janet Abbote that the internet as a technology also
followed a similar developmental trajectory (the initial impetus for
the internet was a computational time sharing system as the micro or
personal computer did not yet exist). What I particularly like about
crafting a narrative that follows the spectrum from "computation" to
"communication" is that it sets me up to explore the second tension I
have observed in the literature.
I like this construction, though it's important  to also consider what it misses (interpretation, for example), and how other keywords might mark both overlaps and divergences.

The second tension in the HC/DH literature is one that can only exist
if the community has been drawn (perhaps magnetically or
gravitationally?) to the communicative side of the spectrum because it
involves the modality of the conversation itself. Increasingly,
definitional works, stances, and explorations about "what is digital
humanities" are taking place outside of the formal mode of scholarly
communication, peer reviewed journal articles and monographs. What I
am seeing in the discourse itself is increasingly taking place on
blogs, twitter, email list, and other "grey literatures."
I agree about the link you're making here, but it's important to note at the outset that your study is aimed at unpacking for the sake of emphasizing the changing landscape of Scholarly Communication, since other avenues might be taken instead (hence other keywords along your spectrum).

So why is this [reference for "this"?] a tension? Why is this interesting? [I'd add "important."] What is there to
note here? At this point, I am not sure I can fully answer these
questions. I still have more work to do synthesizing and thinking
about what I think this grey literature means for the digital
humanities. From the perspective of my prelim I want to explore this
tension because I'd like to use it as a transition point to shift my
discussion from the digital humanities to scholarly publishing. [Or to accentuate rather than shift?] I can
relate this tension to scholarly publishing and the system of
accountability it represents, but I am not yet sure how to expound
upon that fully in the context of the final project of this course.[Not necessarily now, but you could frame this question from the standpoint of tension between innovation and institutionalization.]


 Iguess what I am trying to figure out is what point (if any) do I want
to make about grey literature and the digital humanities that is
independent of a thorough discussion of scholarly publishing.
One idea that comes to me as I write is that as HC/DH has moved along
the spectrum to encompass computational and communicative themes, the
grey literature becomes an increasingly visible constituent of the
field. [I agree, and found ample validation of your point when researching my Mapping Digital Humanities book. Never before have I found so much "good" resource material outside the conventional publication apparatus. You can point as well to the scholarly traffic on the net, including long-form blog writing.] Perhaps I could begin to argue that the digital humanities, as it exists today, relies and requires this grey literature as part of
its very constitution. [The relationship of surface and shadow structure comes to mind here, from the literature on interdisciplinarity.] The presence of blogs, twitter, etc and their
use by digital humanists are being marshaled as a resource for
boundary work. [As spatialized practice - calling to mind de Certau's distinction between "place" and "space. The distinction could work quite nicely for you.]  The active, ongoing and enthusiastic [and advocacy?] use of grey
literature by the digital humanities community is how it becomes
distinct from other fields/domains/disciplines (echos of Bourdieu
here...). Then the argument might be that grey literature and the
multi-modal technologies of communication, along with computational
technology represent two foundational pillars of the digital
humanities. [Parts of Tara's "Scaling Vectors" article come to mind here.] This might be a contentious claim, I'll have to think
about it more...I can think of work that is digital humanities but not
computational. [What? critical cultural studies?]


Hrm. I think I need to read some of Andrew Abbot's
writing about boundaries in the disciplines of sociology. [I rely heavily of boundary work in my work and am happy to share a couple of quick passages that might help with the framing.] So, then the plan will be to follow the thematic spectrum, from the
computational to the communicative, to trace the evolution of
humanities computing into digital humanities through a selective
sampling of the literature. Having arrived at the communicative theme,
I'll give it some depth by synthesizing and analyzing the
conversations across and through both the peer-reviewed literature and
(more importantly) the grey literature to show how the latter
importantly constitutes the field as something different and "other"
from traditional humanities (and perhaps "traditional humanities
computing" as well...hmm). This will then set me up nicely to explore
the scholarly publishing work.
