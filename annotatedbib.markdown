### Humanities Scholarship in the Digital Age 

1.  Anon. n.d. "Hacking the Academy." Retrieved July 21, 2011a (http://hackingtheacademy.org/).
	- these works reflect a rather radical, and purposefully confrontational approach to scholarship, teaching, and XXX, in the academy. 
	- the styles is interesting, several of the articles (the one on open access publishing, and the one about journals & peer review) are written as lists. I find this interesting. Especially in light of the article "reading and writing" which criticizes the tendency towards light reading and "literary" writing.
	- These works for the most part land in the big tent of digital humanities, what is interesting however is some of them speak with a Humanities Comuting lens, but by being situated within a big tent publication re-inforce the fact that the big tent includes humanities computing within it. Now members who identify themselves strongly within the HC enclave (characterized by the McGann, Ramsay, Unsworth, McCarty clique) might react with dismay to such a positioning. Many of the positions they have taken (Ramsay "on coding" & "Who's in Who's out", Unsworth?, McGann-presentational/representational split) are those that bound their notion of the digital humanities squarely within a computational and methodological transformation. They present an unease or even hostility to the broader big tent definitions (best articulated by the Pannacker, but maybe Svensson? Also I am sure Cathy Davidson has staked a claim in the hastac blog somewhere), as to why they do this is

	- Executive summary provides some support for the idea that library support, both in services, sustainability, and space, is still emerging. The relation between the digital humanities and the library is unclear. Some universities have DH centers which have little interaction with the library (GMU comes to mind) vs. universities where all DH support comes from the library. 
	
1.  Borgman, C. L. 2009. "The digital future is now: A call to action for the humanities." Digital Humanities Quarterly 3(4) (http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000077/000077.html).
	- She defines DH as "digital humanities is a new set of practices, using new sets of technologies, to address research problems of the discipline"
	- Digital humanities has a lot of catching up to do with the sciences, infrastructure is lacking.
	- DH infrastructure needs those who do DH, not just developers, to build out infrastructure.
	- "The reasons for the slow adoption of digital publishing in the humanities are many, from not trusting online dissemination to a general reluctance to experiment with new technologies, even those well proven — "professionally indisposed to change" as Ken Hamma puts it [Hamma 2009]"
	- "Monographic publishing, which is core to humanities scholarship, has begun a seismic shift toward digital publishing [Jaschik 2008]; [Jaschik 2009]; [Poe 2001]; [Willinsky 2006]; [Willinsky 2009]. "
	- Digital publishing in the sciences has afforded wider access to scholarship. It seems that Borgman conflates digital publishing with open access (or at least only very briefly engages the difference in paragraph 18) when she talks about increased citation rates for digital publication. There is more nuance she could have gone into here, but chose not to. I find this interesting.
	- She goes on to talk about about technological impact with humanities Data, Research Methods, Collaboration, Incentives, and learning. 
	- Call to acton for Digital humanities:
		- What are Data?
		- What are the infrastructure requirements?
		- Where are the social studies of digital humanities?
		- What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century?
		- What is the value proposition for digital humanities in the era of declining budgets?
	- The shape of these questions implies, to me at least, that Borgman wants the humanities to become more like the sciences. For got and for bad, concepts like "data", "laboratory" are very science centic and make me wonder if they are potentially mutually exclusive to a humanitarian epistemology. At the same time, I complete agree that we need more social studies of digital humanities (exemplified by this projet). The call for infrastructure also appeals to the builder in me, and I agree there needs to be serious effort to tease out the potential difference between scientific and humanities infrastructure. This relates to the value proposition, which is very complicated. From a funding of infrastructure perspective, do we pay for a cathedral or a bizarre (in the eric raymond sense)? What happens if we fund the wrong cathedral? I think there needs to be some fecundity, but there also needs to be a common platform that evolves to support the fecund boutique projects.

	- the slow adoption of multimedia technology is a result from a lack of understanding "work"
	- this slow adoption is creating a humanities version of "technological obsolescence." the use of the term obsolete is interesting. It is a very strong word, stronger than I would use myself, but I think it characterizes the extent to which these authors, and Fitzpatrick believe that the fight over form, modality, and materiality of humanist know production is a fight for survival.
	- "scholarly multimedia threatens the very coherence of humanities scholarship by insisting on the re-embodiment of scholarly activity. "
	- methods (digital humanities, humanities computing) vs objects (new media studies)
	- "By scholarly multimedia we specifically mean critical scholarly works — interpretive and argumentative, as opposed to creative or archival — that are produced, and in some cases performed, in multimedia form."
	- "embodied labor, more narrowly, we mean the physical actions (often disciplined by machinic interactions) that go into interacting with machines"
	-implications of the 'radical sameness' argument: "If multimedia is regarded as no different from other scholarly forms, the complex labor practices and new knowledges required to produce scholarly works of multimedia, such as interface design, coding, video production, hardware support, institutional interactions and so on, may be devalued to the extent that they are seen more as service (akin to maintaining a department's computer lab or website) or not seen as meaningful scholarly activity at all."
	- Hayles argument about how the knowledge is not separate from the materiality which constitutes it: "he materiality of multimedia scholarship is constantly under erasure insofar as we imagine that the heart of any scholarly work (the intellectual part) is purely "informational," as if, like Athena, it springs forth from the scholar's mind and takes up residency inside the book or article or machine. Hayles, drawing on Richard Doyle, calls it an "impossible inversion," where the informational pattern or code is imagined as actually producing the thing on which the pattern nonetheless depends [Hayles 1999b, 293]."
	- the article ends abruptly with this point "The multimedia scholar, by taking seriously the materiality of knowledge production, embodies an intellectual identity that is dispersed over material, rhetorical, and technical networks — a crucial transformation that must be acknowledged when assessing "what counts" as scholarly activity in the academy." There is a nice, but not fully developed point that multimedia is challenging an invisible assumption that we are all, as latour says, "minds in a vat" and that there is a clean separation between the intellectual essence and the material, rhetorical, and technical realities of our scholarly output. I think I might be able to re-organize their argument here in terms of organizational routines. In a sense, being a multi-media scholar requires an engagement above and beyond "the way it has been done before." Writing a monograph or journal article _does_ have a set of material, rhetorical, and technological realities, but our attentiveness to them, our performative practices, are deeply embodied in the habits and routines of scholars that we are, collectively, no longer cognizant of those performances. This "work" has faded into the invisible and assumed background expectancies, an invisible background frame used to render visible new work. Multimedia scholarship pulls those habits, routines and background expectencies into the light and problematizes them alongside the "intellectual essence" that normally counts as "visible work"

	- "Humanities computing is precisely the automation of every possible analysis of human expression (therefore, it is exquisitely a "humanistic" activity), in the widest sense of the word, from music to the theater, from design and painting to phonetics, but whose nucleus remains the discourse of written texts." This is a very expansive definition, however he is still bounding it with the word "automation." It is interesting if instead of automate we replace with the work augmentation.  
	- Three perspectives
		- "Technological "Miniaturization"
		- "textual Informatics
			- Contains three sub-currents, two dominant ones, documentary and editorial, which as described by Busa are more communicative in nature and a subordinate interpretive current, this is squarely a computational and methodological current.
		- "Hermeneutic Informatics"  - "This third sort of informatics was the first to come into being" 
	- Busa is very heavy handed with the computational linguistics, there is not a hint of post-structuralist thought in the piece. He is a humanist of a previous age.

	- like Kirchembaum (others) attributes significance to the formation of the Office of Digital Humanities.
	- "Nonetheless, we have been slow to explore the potential of interactive, immersive, and multimedia expression for our own thinking and scholarship, even as we dab-ble with such forms in our teaching. With a few exceptions, we remain content to comment about technology and media, rather than to participate more actively in constructing knowledge in and through our objects of study." IN AND THROUGH - very important words but also represent the heart of the very problem. Meaning and understanding are archived in and through our modalities of communication. EM/CA has taught us that destablilizing those communicative forms can destabilize our communal sense of 'knowing.' You can vote in/out politicians to incur change or you can change the structure of voting yourself. There is risk here.
	- "the multimodal scholar. This third type of digital humanist in effect blends many of the desires and goals of the other “early adopters,” the computing humanist and blogging humanist. " 
	- "Media and film scholars should be working with technologists, presses, policy makers, and librarians to shape the very contours of the technologies we will use to imag-ine, produce, and disseminate our scholarly work in years to come."

1.  Unsworth, John M. n.d. "Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences." Retrieved June 3, 2009  (http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/Cyberinfrastructure.RLG.html).
	-"cyberinfrastructure refers to infrastructure based upon distributed computer, information and communication technology. If infrastructure is required for an industrial economy, then we could say that cyberinfrastructure is required for a knowledge economy. "
	-"And why should the humanities and social sciences care about it? Because we can make it a better infrastructure, if our perspectives, our training, and our expertise are included in its design and deployment. After all, science—whose goal is predictive certainty—only has half the picture. Uncertainty (or ambiguity, if you prefer) is the other half, and the humanities and social sciences celebrate that, explore it, tolerate it, and understand it better than the sciences do." this point about dealing with uncertainty is interesting. I wish he would expand upon that, I wish he would expand upon many of these point, more because while I believe the intended audience shares that assumption, not everyone does. Furthermore, _how_ do the humanities deal with uncertainty? What are their methods (on a very loose sense)bendable them to deal with uncertainty better. The other interesting point is how Unsworth argues for the inclusion of humanists in the design and deployment of infrastructure. Again, there is an assumption that humanists do it better, but based on the technology design and deployment i have already seen I am not convinced that really bring anything to the table. Counterpoint is Steve Jobs and Apple computer, much of their success has been because of an attention of the humanities and the liberal arts in the design of their products (example the typeface on the original Mac due to Steve's calligraphy course at Reed. While we shouldn't take that story at face value, I think we should not dismiss the influence of the liberal arts and humanists principles that pervade his work.)
	-"the humanities and social sciences want to have some influence in the process now underway to design our information technology environment over the next decade, then we need to articulate our needs and our potential contributions—and even more than that, we need to articulate the importance of the humanities and the social sciences, for the amelioration of the human condition."
	-observe the strong progressive tone as pointed out by Flanders 2009. 
	- "The humanities, in particular, has been without a galvanizing methodology for a generation now, and it is being, and will be, revolutionized by information technology as profoundly as any of the sciences...That revolution, though, has some preconditions: it requires a motivating factor, to move the disciplines toward new methods, and it requires the means—both intellectual and financial—to adopt, refine, and disseminate those methods for the rising generation of scholars." VIVA the revolution. But it is only a revolution in methods.
	- intellectual property & privacy issues are seen by Unsworth as technical challenges in the building, like bandwidth, storage. This is a rather problematic move because IP and privacy are various obviously social constructs (one could argue so is bandwidth and storage, but those are not quite as immediately obvious in my eyes). To blindly try and solve privacy or IP issues with technical solutions leads to tears. See the ongoing facebook privacy issues or the HathiTrust issues. Technical infrastructure has a formal certainty that does not exist for IP or Privacy. This is the Social-technical gap that Ackerman points out (2000).

the Council on Library and Information Resources and The National Endowment for the Humanities (http://www.clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub145abst.html)
	-Asking Questions and Building a  Research Agenda for Digital Scholarship - Amy Friedlander
	- "humanists have access to technology but are in search of questions: What scholarship becomes possible when, from their desktops, scholars can access vast stores of admittedly highly het-erogeneous data together with powerful capabilities for analysis and presentation?"
	- infrastructure answers the "how" but humanities needs a research program to answer the "what" and "why"
	-"There exists an important but often-ignored distinction between the research programs that rely on an infrastructure and the research infrastructure itself."
	- This echos the calls for "grand challenges" what are the big problems in the humanities? Of course isn't this a problematic question? Can any question ever be "solved" in the humanities, seems like there is an epistemological conflict here. But this might also speak to my ignorance of the humanitiers.

**** The Programming Debate

	1. Salter, Anastasia. 2011. "Program or Be Programmed" http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/program-or-be-programmed

	1. Ramsey, Steven. 2011. "Who's in and Who's out" 
		- "Nowadays, the term can mean anything from media studies to electronic art, from data mining to edutech, from scholarly editing to anarchic blogging, while inviting code junkies, digital artists, standards wonks, transhumanists, game theorists, free culture advocates, archivists, librarians, and edupunks under its capacious canvas." Here is evidence, albiet critical, that the boundary of DH has blown out to become something bigger than humanities computing. The question is "can this big tent be productive" Ramsey very strongly comes down with "no." He believe very strongly that DH is about building and about the theory of building. 
		- "Community and collaboration are undoubtedly signs of the spirit, but to say that disciplinary definition doesn't really matter is to eschew the hard reality of life in the modern academy. Digital Humanities is not some airy Lyceum. It is a series of concrete instantiations involving money, students, funding agencies, big schools, little schools, programs, curricula, old guards, new guards, gatekeepers, and prestige. It might be more than these things, but it cannot not be these things." too broad or too pourous of boundary and the category becomes useless (or does it? one might make an arguement about the indexical nature of "digital humanities" as a term and the discursive work that it accomplishes by virtue of being ambigious).
		- "no discipline can survive without actively engaging with disciplinary questions. Not because there are definitive answers. Least of all because it's important to alienate people. But simply because without those questions, we cede the answers to institutions eager to oblige people who are paying attention." Digital Humanities needs its Grand Challenges to bind it.
		-"Personally, I think Digital Humanities is about building things." OK, so then what does it mean "to build" and what "things." 
		-"I am willing to entertain highly expansive definitions of what it means to build something. I also think the discipline includes and should include people who theorize about building, people who design so that others might build, and those who supervise building (the coding question is, for me, a canard, insofar as many people build without knowing how to program). I'd even include people who are working to rebuild systems like our present, irretrievably broken system of scholarly publishing." I am glad that he includes scholarly publishing here, I guess that means I am a digital humanist.

	1. Ramsey, Stephen. 2011. "On Building" http://lenz.unl.edu/papers/2011/01/11/on-building.html
		- "to me, there's always been a profound – and profoundly exciting and enabling – commonality to everyone who finds their way to DH. And that commonality, I think, involves moving from reading and critiquing to building and making. "
		-"Building is, for us, a new kind of hermeneutic – one that is quite a bit more radical than taking the traditional methods of humanistic inquiry and applying them to digital objects. Media studies, game studies, critical code studies, and various other disciplines have brought wonderful new things to humanistic study, but I will say (at my peril) that none of these represent as radical a shift as the move from reading to making." Building as Hermeneutic is interesting, I think it moves us well beyond ideas of DH utopian progressivism into a space of critical reflection
		-"We should be able to be clear about the importance of project management and thing knowledge – the tacit knowledge of fabrication and its cultures – even if the very nature of that poiesis (knowledge of making) itself cannot easily (and shouldn’t have to) be put into words." practice <-> Knowledge



### What is Digital Humanities? A Brief Definition

1. Flanders, Julia. 2009. "The Productive Unease of 21st-century Digital Scholarship" Digital Humanities Quarterly
	- I haven't been able to figure out where she falls on the digital humanities / humanities computing debate. I need to do a closer reading to discern what distinction she sees in the terms. 
	- "Despite prevailingly progressive narratives surrounding the impact of digital technology on modern academic culture, the field of digital humanities is characterized at a deeper level by a more critical engagement with technology. This engagement, which I characterize as a kind of "productive unease", is focused around issues of representation, medium, and structures of scholarly communication." I like this formulation of the Digital Humanities as fundamentally about a deeply engaged critique of technology.
	- "the digital humanities domain reflects the non-progressiveness of the humanities disciplines more generally, and also reveals what may be a fundamental tension at its heart. If the rhetoric at the heart of the "digital" side of "digital humanities" is strongly informed by a narrative of technological progress, the "humanities" side has equally strong roots in a humanities sensibility which both resists a cumulative idea of progress (one new thing building on another) and yearns for a progressive agenda (doing better all the time)." 
	- "I would argue that we can recognize humanities computing in his sense of the term, precisely by a kind of productive unease that results from the encounter and from its product....But where that sense of friction is absent — where a digital object sits blandly and unobjectionably before us, putting up no resistance and posing no questions for us — humanities computing, in the meaningful sense, is also absent. Humanists may learn from the content of such objects, treated as research materials, as they always have." 

1. Kirschenbaum, Matthew. 2010. "What Is Digital Humanities and What's It Doing in English Departments?" ADE Bulletin. Number 150, 2010. (http://mkirschenbaum.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/kirschenbaum_ade150.pdf)
	-  main claim - "computers have been part of our disciplinary lives for well over two decades now. During this time digital humanities has accumulated a robust professional apparatus that is probably more rooted in English than any other departmental home."
	- In talking about the Wikipedia definition of DH "a glance at the page's View history tab reveals individuals closely associated with the digital humanities..."  The "view history" tab in wikipedia is like the "view source" tab in web browsers. with one click we can see the provenance of a statement within wikipedia. These "source" views are extremely powerful and I think we haven't quite come to grips with just how powerful they are. Kirschenbaum is, through the power of view-history, able to contextualize the wikipedia definition, tracing its provenance back to authorities in the digital humanities world. What is interesting is that he didn't take the wikipedia definition at face value, he looked deeper. 
	- "at its core, then, digital humanities is more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even technologies....Yet digital humanities is also a social undertaking. It harbors networks of people who have been working together, sharing research, arguing, competing, and collaborating for many years. " - to claim it is merely method is to cut off and isolate all of the social "work" that has emerged from the intersection of humanities and technology. It ignores the _communicative_ change in favor of the _computational_ change.
	- Three Key events in the emergence of the "digital humanities"
		- The Companion to the Digital Humanities
		- Formation of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations
		- The Digital Humanities Initiative by the NEH
	- Brett Bobley on Digital Humanities vs humanities computing - "seemed to cast a wider net than “humanities computing” which seemed to imply a form of computing, whereas “digital humanities” implied a form of human-ism. I also thought it would be an easier sell to the humanities community to have the emphasis on “humanities.”" I have said this before, but I think it is important that a funding agency has taken a big tent, communicative approach to digital humanities rather than a HC, computational approach. There seems to be a purposeful movement away from the computational implication and towards the "bigger" implications which for my purposes I am going to call "communicative" because, well, I'm not sure how you can get any bigger than communicative. It is all about the communication.
	- Kirschenbaum also explicitly acknowledges the impact of twitter, citing MLA '09 when all the DH'ers tweeted up a storm.
	- "the network effects of blogs and Twitter at a moment when the academy itself is facing massive and often wrenching changes linked both to new technologies and the changing political and economic landscape has led to the construction of “digital humanities” as a free- floating signifier, one that increasingly serves to focus the anxiety and even outrage of individual scholars over their own lack of agency amid the turmoil in their institutions and profession."
	- "Digital humanities has also, I would propose, lately been galvanized by a group of younger (or not so young) graduate students, faculty members (both tenure line and contingent), and other academic professionals who now wield the label “digital humanities” instrumentally amid an increasingly monstrous institutional terrain defined by declining public support for higher education, rising tuitions, shrinking endowments, the proliferation of distance education and the for- profit university, and, underlying it all, the conversion of full- time, tenure- track academic labor to a part- time adjunct workforce. "
	- "Whatever else it might be then, the digital humanities today is about a scholarship (and a pedagogy) that is publicly visible in ways to which we are generally unaccustomed, a scholarship and pedagogy that are bound up with infrastructure in ways that are deeper and more explicit than we are generally accustomed to, a scholarship and pedagogy that are collaborative and depend on networks of people and that live an active 24/7 life online."

	- "Though the promise of digital technology in almost any field has been to let one do the same things one did before but better and faster, the more fundamental result has often been the capability of doing entirely new things. It is very possible that digital libraries will enable future humanities scholars to engage in new activities that we haven't yet envisioned." echos of a revolution/evolution. the environment has shifted, now we have to explore various adaptations to find new niches.
	- conceptual steps of technological development "The conceptual steps typically include first trying to replicate core activities that functioned in the analogue environment, then attempting to replicate some (but not all) of the non-core analogue functions, then (after using the systems for some time) discovering and implementing new functions that did not exist within the previous analogue environment."  - echos of macluhan ' the old medium becomes the message of the new medium'
	- Besser argues for the importance of (metadata) standards, but I wonder to what extent timing is a key factor of standardization and adoption of said standard. Standardize too soon and you risk not fully taking advantage of the affordances of the new medium, standardize too late and you risk ???? non-adoption and irrevelant (XHTML 2.0).
	- he is walking around Semantic web / linked data standards. I think one of the major challenges for these technologies is that they do no include the actor, author, linker as a direct part of the ontology. all things linked are linked by a linker.
	- " to replicate the power that libraries have developed, we need truly persistent naming. This means more than just the indication of a location for a particular work. Sophisticated persistent naming would include the ability to designate a work by its name, and to distinguish between various instantiations of that work and their physical locations."  What if the digital object were its own name? why do we need bins, why can't we just use its artifactual identity as its name? I am led to this thought when thinking about how to cite within digital texts that have no page numbers. Why cite "paragraph 345, sentence 4" when you could just cite the content itself and then search for it within the text. use the power of search. 
	- " as Lawrence Lessig has made clear, the choices we make in the architecture and design of our systems will limit the social choices we can make around use of those systems in the future (Lessig 1999)." we are spending a lot of time trying to standardize how we structure the relations between information/data/knowledge, but the structure of the relations is going to be different for every person on the planet. rather we should be focusing on standardizing the the methods and techniques we use to search information/data/knowledge. the identity of the digital thing is the thing itself.  "but what if the thing changes?" well, if we are certain maintain a history of its transformations (GIT on steroids) we can search an objects provenance AND see what new objects it has birthed. This is the true power of linked data. I want to use the Digital humanities 1.0 pdf as a search query and get the 2.0 version back as a search result.
	- is "digital library" a horseless carriage?
* Palmer, Carole “Thematic Research Collections.” in Siemens, Ray, John Unsworth, and Susan Schreibman. 2004. Companion to Digital Humanities (Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture). Hardcover. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Professional Retrieved (http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/).
	- "Thematic research collections are evolving as a new genre of scholarly production in response to these opportunities. They are digital aggregations of primary sources and related materials that support research on a theme." I am reminded of Ann Blairs book "Too Much To Know" and how she argues that the in response to information overload new textual forms emerged, namely note / summary collections. These became legitimate publications in and of themselves.
	- "John Unsworth (2000b) describes thematic collections as being:
		-electronic
		-heterogeneous datatypes
		-extensive but thematically coherent
		-structured but open-ended
		-designed to support research
		-authored or multi-authored
		-interdisciplinary
		-collections of digital primary resources"
	-"While thematic collections support both research and pedagogy, the scholarly contribution that results from the creation and use of the resources is what qualifies them as a scholarly genre. When electronic sources are brought together for scholarly purposes they become a new, second-generation electronic resource (Unsworth 2000b). "
	- "like research generated in the fields of engineering, computer science, and information science, some of the research contribution lies in the technical design, functionality, and innovation that makes new kinds of research possible."
	- "the creators of scholarly collections will need to be a new kind of scholar, or team, with a distinct mix of expertise in at least three areas – the specific subject matter and associated critical and analytical techniques, technical computing processes, and principles of content selection and organization."
	- "The thematic collections concentrating on contextual mass and activity support are coming closest to creating a laboratory environment where the day-to-day work of scholars can be performed."
	- "Now scholars have also become creators of research collections, and this change will have an important impact on how our vast arrays of research materials take shape in the future....Where libraries once acquired the documents authored by scholars, they now also need to collect the thematic research collections created by scholars."
	-"The traditional cycle of document transfer as conceptualized before the advent of digital documents (King and Bryant 1971) "
	- "Scholar-created research collections are likely to increase in number as the work of producing them becomes more widely accepted as legitimate scholarship."
	-  "As scholars gain mastery in digital collocation and produce innovative research environments, they are practicing a new kind of collection development. Thematic collections are conceived not only as support for scholarship but as contributions to scholarship. "
* "The Digital Humanities and Humanities Computing: An Introduction" 
	-"Moreover, digital humanities now also concerns itself with the creation of new artifacts which are born digital and require rigorous study and understanding in their own right."
	-"the revolution has succeeded: in almost all disciplines, the power of computers, and even their potential, no longer seem revolutionary at all." Perhaps the computational revolution, but certainly not the communicative revolution. Vectors is still a contentious journal, the place of born digital scholarship is still not quite understood. The claim the the revolution is over means the revolution was modest and methodological at best, something that hardly a revolution as much as a generational shift.
	- "The field also places great importance on the means of disseminating the results of these activities and, as Pitti discusses, recognizes that project conception and management can be as important pragmatic concerns as others which are more traditionally associated with disciplinary pursuits."
	- "The process that one goes through in order to develop, apply, and compute these knowledge representations is unlike anything that humanities scholars, outside of philosophy, have ever been required to do. This method, or perhaps we should call it a heuristic, discovers a new horizon for humanities scholarship, a paradigm as powerful as any that has arisen in any humanities discipline in the past – and, indeed, maybe more powerful, because the rigor it requires will bring to our attention undocumented features of our own ideation." This relates to the notion that our digital representations are forcing a reflexive discussion not only about the nature of the digital artifact, but also the nature of its provenance. The processes, practices and infrastructures are intertwined with assumption that must critically be made visible. We might theorize that in older works these assumptions have been reified to the point of invisibility. While they are present, they rest upon a pragmatic agreement that makes their critical and reflexive acknowledgement uncessisary. The works of humanities computing and digital humanities, which represent both new forms and functions do not rest upon a similar pragmatic agreement (at least not yet)) so we find that scholars must do twice as much work to account for their work (As Tara McPherson put it, "as a digital scholar you have to do 150% of the work" personal communication). 


1.  Svensson, P. 2010. "The landscape of digital humanities." Digital Humanities Quarterly 4(1). (http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/1/000080/000080.html)
	- he defines multiple spheres of definition
	- five ways digital humanities treats information technology or as he says "modes of engagement"
		- as a tool
		- as a study object, 
		- as an expressive medium, 
		- as an experimental laboratory and 
		- as an activist venue.
	- so one of the things that I was dissatisfied about in Svensson's description of activism was the lack of distinction between activism in a general political sense, that is activities trying to promote a subaltern community versus activities focused on the humanities and the academy itself. The digital humanities is certainly a general activist venue, but so are all disciplines and fields. What is unique about the digital humanities is how it has become a venue for activism challenging the academic system itself.
	- the descriptions of DH as a tool or experimental medium are part of this "first wave of dh" or what I want to call humanities computing.

1.  Unsworth, John. 2002. "What is Humanities Computing, and What is Not?" (http://computerphilologie.uni-muenchen.de/jg02/unsworth.html)
	- "..one of the many things you can do with computers is something that I would call humanities computing, in which the computer is used as tool for modeling humanities data and our understanding of it, and that activity is entirely distinct from using the computer when it models the typewriter, or the telephone, or the phonograph, or any of the many other things it can be." From Flanders 2009
	- "[h]umanities computing is a practice of representation, a form of modeling or [...] mimicry. It is[...] a way of reasoning and a set of ontological commitments, and its representational practice is shaped by the need for efficient computation on the one hand, and for human communication on the other." From Flanders 2009
	- "It is also (as Davis and his co-authors put it) a way of reasoning and a set of ontological commitments, and its representational practice is shaped by the need for efficient computation on the one hand, and for human communication on the other." Bingo! my spectrum!
	-"one of the many things you can do with computers is something that I would call humanities computing, in which the computer is used as tool for modeling humanities data and our understanding of it, and that activity is entirely distinct from using the computer when it models the typewriter, or the telephone, or" 
	-"if it doesn't have a way to be wrong, if one can't say whether it does or doesn't work, whether it is or isn't internally consistent and logically coherent, then it's something other than humanities computing" I wonder if Unsworth would say the same thing about digital humanities?
	-"one way in which that degree can be measured is by the interactivity offered to users who wish to frame their own research questions. If there is none offered, and no interactivity, then the project is probably pure charlatanism. If it offers some (say, keyword searching), then it can be taken a bit more seriously. If it offers structured searching, a bit more so. If it offers combinatorial queries, more so. If it allows you to change parameters and values in order to produce new models, it starts to look very much like something that must be built on a thoroughgoing representation. If it lets you introduce new algorithms for calculating the outcomes of changed parameters and values, then it is extremely well designed indeed. And so on." this reminds me of Gibbs discussion of a framework for critiquing digital humanities works. This highlights what I personally hate about the Blake or Dickenson archives and what I like about the perseus archive. The former are simply web pages and the latter provides robust search, and API?, and raw data. I agree with this metric, as far as it relates to Humanities Computing, or data stores/bases/archives in the digital humanities.
	- "So, as Willard McCarty has often noted, we have a problem distinguishing between computing in the service of a research agenda framed by the traditional parameters of the humanities, or, on the other hand, the much rarer, more peculiar case where the humanities research agenda itself is framed and formed by what we can do with computers."
	-"Humanities computing, as a practice of knowledge representation, grapples with this realization that its representations are surrogates in a very self-conscious way, more self-conscious, I would say, than we generally are in the humanities when we ›represent‹ the objects of our attention in essays, books, and lectures." here again I see a nod to the reflexive nature inherent in this mode that is taken for granted in older traditional modes.
	-"Humanities computing as a way of reasoning"
	-"Humanities computing as a set of ontological commitments" my spectrum in essence represents scholars/scholarship that emphasizes certain ontological commitments over others. It is important to note it is a relation not an absolute commitment. 
	-"Davis et al. conclude that any efficiency stands opposed in some way to the fullness of expression, and that "[e]ither end of this spectrum seems problematic: we ignore computational considerations at our peril, but we can also be overly concerned with them, producing representations that are fast but inadequate for real use."
	-davis on representation and communication "Knowledge representations are also the means by which we express things about the world, the medium of expression and communication in which we tell the machine (and perhaps one another) about the world. [...] a medium of expression and communication for use by us. That in turn presents two important sets of questions. One set is familiar: How well does the representation function as a medium of expression? How general is it? How precise? Does it provide expressive adequacy? etc. An important question less often discussed is, How well does it function as a medium of communication? That is, how easy is it for us to »talk« or think in that language? What kinds of things are easily said in the language and what kinds of things are so difficult as to be pragmatically impossible? Note that the questions here are of the form »how easy is it?« rather than »can we?« This is a language we must use, so things that are possible in principle are useful but insufficient; the real question is one of pragmatic utility. If the representation makes things possible but not easy, then as real users we may never know whether we have misunderstood the representation and just do not know how to use it, or it truly cannot express some things we would like to say. A representation is the language in which we communicate, hence we must be able to speak it without heroic effort." this is vital to understanding Unsworth's position on the constitution of scholarship.
	- on formalization "what is important about the requirement of formal expression is that it puts humanities computing, or rather the computing humanist, in the position of having to do two things that mostly, in the humanities, we don't do: provide unambiguous expressions of ideas, and provide them according to stated rules. In short, once we begin to express our understanding of, say, a literary text in a language such as XML, a formal grammar that requires us to state the rules according to which we will deploy that grammar in a text or texts, then we find that our representation of the text is subject to verification – for internal consistency, and especially for consistency with the rules we have stated."

1. Pannapacker, William. 2011. "Big-Tent Digital Humanities: a View From the Edge, Part 2" The Chronicle of Higher Education. September 18 2011. (http://chronicle.com/article/Big-Tent-Digital-Humanities-a/129036/)
	- Pannapacker defines digital humanities in a way I really like. His definition situates DH within a larger academic cultural context, a context that is specifically undergoing a radical change. He sums it up - "Digital humanities is a comprehensive activist project that uses technology to respond to the interconnected cultural and structural problems of academe." he goes on "It redefines the nature of academic careers while dealing with longstanding disciplinary conversations. And it engages in complex, theoretical heavy lifting while building projects that are often based on the Internet, available to the public, and indisputably useful...Like the founders and builders of museums, libraries, concert halls, and critical editions in the last century, digital humanists are creating the new infrastructure of our history and culture and changing the nature of education and scholarship."
	- I think it is no coincidence that I see many self-identified digital humanists writing blog posts, articles and op-eds not only about the changes in their own discipline, but about the broader changes happening in higher education. While the focus is generally on the humanities, the university as an institution or about the nature of being a scholar in general, the sciences do come into play, at least in their relation to the institution. Scientific research however is generally not a topic oft written about in this context.


Report on Summit Accomplishments. 2005. Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities
	-"It was the consensus of participants that only about six percent of humanist scholars go beyond general purpose information technology and use digital resources and more complex digital tools in their scholarship"
	- "When information technology is introduced into a discipline or some social activity there seem to be two stages. First, the technology is used to automate what users were already doing, but now doing it better, faster and possibly cheaper. In the second stage (which does not always occur), a revolution takes place. Entirely new phenomena arise." they are talking about skeuomorthism and two phases of technological adoption, first scientists did their arthimetic faster, then they started simulating. 
	- "It is the belief of the Organizing Committee that humanists are on the verge of such a revolutionary change in their scholarship, enabled by information technology. The objective of the Summit was to test that hypothesis and challenge some leading humanist scholars to enunciate what that revolutionary change might be and how to achieve it. "
	- "four processes of humanistic scholarship where innovative change was occurring, and that, taken collectively, advancements in those areas could possibly lead to a new stage in humanistic scholarship:
		- Interpretation 
		- Exploration of Resources
		- Collaboration
		- Visualization of Time, Space, & Uncertainty 
	- "In the next phase, interpretation may move from private to public, from informal to formal, as the interpreter rehearses and performs it, intending to persuade other readers to share an interest and some conclusions." This is the transition from knowledge to scholarship. I like the inclusion of "performance" as part of the making public part, its is reminiscent of Goffman, but it is the performance of your scholarly self in everyday life.
	- In the Interpretation section this is basically a requirements process for a tool for use in the interpretation of texts. They perform a rudamentary UxD process with short use-case/user stories. They really need a UxD professional in the room to facilitate that kind of requirements brainstorming. It is a good start and highlights the need. I wonder if these scholars don't necessarily know that an entire class of professional exists to help them design tools.
	- They envision a tool, "google search aide for scholars" that leverages the latest information retrieval tools.
	- "Digital scholarly projects, especially if they use custom software for presentation and processing, demand a level of technical, managerial, and design expertise that content providers often do not possess." The are using a line of argument that talks about how the skills needed to implement a modern 'digital scholarly project' have extended far beyond the range of domain scholars. Collaborators, like archivists, programmers, etc. are necessary to provide technical expertise. Demand for technicals skills will push us away from individual author/scholar
	- "peer review of tools" This is along the lines of Besser?'s arguement that thematic collections should count as scholarship. Given the huge demand for special collections and tools, we need to incentivize scholars to work on these projects. Unfortunately, as long as the heart and minds of scholars are focused on publishing journals & books than tools, archives, collections, and other "service" will play second fiddle. Given the lack of both money and attention it seems like this might be a solution to the problem. A significant require would be that these tools be open source, otherwise their long-term maintainence becomes problematics (although open source doesn't "solve" this problem it is a requirement for success in this regard). Also, it could be a temporary situation, at some point the landscape of tool needs will stabilize, the low hanging fruit will have been picked. It will become more difficult to make a tool contribution (although I'm sure there will always be a need for maintainence). Could the R project be an example of this? Who maintains R? How is it sustained? Has anyone gotten credit for making a contribution to R?
	- "revolutionary change in digitally-enabled, humanities scholarship is possible because the “right” computer and communications technology aids permit new kinds of analysis and profoundly interactive collaboration that was not possible before."

1. Gibbs, Fred. 2011 "Critical Discourse in the Digital Humanities" http://historyproef.org/blog/digital-humanities/critical-discourse-in-the-digital-humanities/
    - "i suggest that DH criticism needs to go beyond typical peer review and inhabit a genre of its own—a critical discourse—that itself provides a valuable service both inside and outside the community. More importantly, criticism and the intellectual work that it does makes the value of our work clearer to those outside of the DH community."
    - "rubrics for evaluating DH work."
    - "Everyone in the field knows that the most innovative DH projects cannot be fully evaluated through the traditional, critical, and theoretical lenses of the humanities. But what lenses do we have?" 
    - "Not only do we need a more crystallized rubric, but new models of publishing now require a fundamentally new kind of peer review—and i don’t mean simply online peer review or open peer review, two efforts that i think have gotten the lion’s share of (much-needed) attention when it comes to reforming antiquated review processes. The multifaceted nature of DH requires a different kind of critique than is typical in the humanities because it puts rather unique demands on both critics and criticism itself."
    - "will suffice for present purposes to say that digital humanities is different enough from the analog humanities, at least at the moment. But allow me a brief moment of justification that will be important later on. The digital humanities are of course not fundamentally different in any larger epistemological or hermeneutic sense from the humanities at large."
    - "Part of what defines a discipline is its rhetoric and the aesthetics of its scholarly discourse. Philosophy texts sound different from history texts, which sound different from literary analysis. These differences become especially apparent during collaborative projects. As much as we champion cross-disciplinary work, there is an inherent unease to it, in no small part because it becomes harder to tell how to evaluate it. Given a particular piece of scholarship: How should one read it? Which criteria should be applied?" 
    - "in the larger view, they’re there." are they really there? I am not entirely convinced. this reminds me of the missing masses argument and of structural sociology. perhaps my micro is showing, bu i can buy into the idea that they are "there" in any real sense except in our discursive practice, the reality of which cannot and should not be denied, but should be put in its place.
    - "One major way in which DH is in fact separate from the humanities (again, at least for now) is in that it requires new ways of evaluating very complex work in terms that are often unfamiliar to most humanists." there are no maps to these territories
    - William Thomas’s article, “Writing a Digital History Journal Article from Scratch.” this article is listed under "documents" a non distinctive section in his CV that lists what appears to be non peer reviewed work
    - "What we might perceive as ignorance on the part of reviewers is at least in part because the rhetoric and aesthetics of DH work is not particularly well established. In other words, the critical sphere has not yet materialized." 
    - "we can’t be unhappy that tradition-bound hiring committees, promotion and tenure committees, deans, and other humanists don’t appreciate the value of our work when we haven’t really outlined how it’s different and how it should be appreciated." 
    - "We haven’t provided a public critical discourse that offers the traditional signals to those who are not expert as to what work is good and what is not—and thus serves as a compass for practitioners, critics, and outsiders alike. In sum, DH needs more critical theory" 
    - "We haven’t provided a public critical discourse that offers the traditional signals to those who are not expert as to what work is good and what is not—and thus serves as a compass for practitioners, critics, and outsiders alike." 
    - "Exactly what constitutes the sound scholarship that we want to do (and actually do) is not nearly as apparent to others, especially those outside the DH community, as it should be. It befalls the producers of that good scholarship to explain what is and what is not considered good, and why." this might be the seed to answer the question of how to chsnge the regime of accountability
    - "a critical discourse for DH would be far more valuable than grant applications that sell potential work and post-facto white papers that champion whatever work happened to get completed. We need more than traditional journal articles that describe the so-called “real” humanities research that came out of digital projects. "
    - "Matthew Arnold in his The Function of Criticism at the Present Time defined it as “a disinterested endeavor to learn and propagate the best that is known as thought in the world.” (1864/5, 75) "
    - "criticism is especially good at establishing and debating terms of how to analyze a particular work. This discourse of critique where new standards get hammered out. It’s the connective tissue of projects that pronouncements from on-high simply cannot have." 
    - "There is the MLA site that outlines types of digital work; guidelines for evaluating digital work." als "NINES guidelines for peer review."
    - Criteria for criticism:
        - Design 
        - Data
        - Reusability
        - Transparency 
    - "While traditional scholarship (books and articles) is held accountable to its stated goals and methodologies (as far as the medium permits), digital projects have not had that accountability from the scholarly community." 
    - "we do need more peer review! But that’s not all. We need a fundamentally different kind of peer review. Just as the nature of publishing is changing, the nature of peer review must evolve, especially for large DH projects, but even individual ones as well. Digital humanities work requires a different kind of criticism than most academic criticism because of the very nature of the work. DH projects often serve much broader audiences, and embody interdisciplinary in a way that eludes traditional models of critique." 
    - "More people to review individual projects. How many people can really critique various facets of a digital humanities project, when they range from graphic design, interface design, code, encoding standards, etc. Even if one could, it’s a herculean task not befitting the typical lone reviewer "
    - "DH work is often iterative in nature, and the review process needs to be as well. Just as digital humanities projects are inherently more public than the typical humanities project, everyone benefits when their critiques are more public." 
    - " A project without accountability, without connectedness, without critique, simply fills another plot in the DH project graveyard." i likes gibbs use of the term accountability here. this is exactly the angle i want to take. the regime of accountability, that is in Gibbs terms the system of critique, evaluation, and review for scholarly products needs to change as to accommodate the new forms of scholarship that are emerging from the digital humanities.....one thing i want to note is that the criteria that Gibbs has proposed is very close to those being used in Science. indeed he does have a rather scientifical vision of digital scholarship (with data and cod and process and method). this is a slippery slope.
    -Forms of Critique
        - "formalist critique examines the form of the work, examining how well its structure, form, and design serve its purpose in the context of similar works;"
        - "didactic criticism focuses on the ability for the work to reach, inform, and educate an audience;" 
        - "mimetic criticism might evaluate how well the DH work is truly humanist work or facilitates it (this replaces “universe” in the original diagram);" 
        - "expressive critique discuss how the work reflects the unique characteristics and style of the creator(s). Here the “team” anchor replaces the original “artist” label,"
    - "we must remember that code and metadata, as well as data and whatever structures govern it, are not entirely objective entities but are informed, attacked, and defended by ideology and theory."

	- Argument here is that publishers need to move beyond the sustainability montra, for that implies that the current status quo is something worth maintaining, and start thinking about innovation and growth. Esposito believe that "marketing" is the key to this growth.
	- To help academic publishers think about the future he has created a five stage framework. 
	- The editorial function is the most important function because it is, from the perspective of energy, the function that costs the most. If we think about the digital ecosystem, the cost of adding things into the mix is cheap. Blogs, tweets, epubs, the marginal cost (is this what I mean, marginal cost?) approaches zero. But curating from that flood of information is increasingly difficult. There is a very fundamental principal at work here, a principal from information theory and physicals. There is a really good description of this principal in Gleick's history of information. Basically, adding information to a system is easy, _removing_ information from the system is hard.
	- [my opinion] The challenge for presses is to assert/insert themselves as the agents of  information removal/deletion/curation/selection. They need to switch their roles, away from that of a publisher of information, to that of selectors of information. It is apropos that Raggae/danchall DJ's used to call themselves Selectors. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selector_(disc_jockey)
	- What is the scholarly equivalent of the DJ. The Scholarly Selector. The Journal Jockie. DJ Monograph.
	-"Although we know a publisher by its editorial choices, the organizational and business context in which those choices are made have become increasingly complex, and that complexity is likely to grow even more in the years ahead" The work of a publisher extends well beyond their editorial role. Before the current complexities of the publishing ecosystem, presses distinguished themselves via their editorial prowess. But now there are a host of other decisions that distinguish them. "There is almost nothing about scholarly publishing that is not changing. Thus, the editorial strategy is but one of many factors that go into a particular press's success. And this is the reason that university presses today have to think and plan beyond their editorial departments."

	- Vectors is interesting b/c it prints only things that "can't exist in print"
	- "I believe that electronic publishing should not merely aim to port the printed page directly to the web (even in searchable form), but should, rather, investigate new publication practices that take advantage of the capacities for rich multimedia and networked communication that the Internet offers."
	- "Thus, Vectors has functioned largely as an experimental space, publishing work that is formally challenging and that explores the boundaries of what might count as scholarly argument. Pairing interactive designers and technologists with humanities scholars, we aim to limn the boundaries between creative expression and scholarship, more seamlessly wedding scholarly form and content."
	- She sees vectors as an open access collaboration between scholars, technolgists, and interaction designers. It is a "kind of laboratory for emerging genres of scholarly practice."
	- "When we began Vectors, very few “traditional” humanities scholars were producing richly multimedia scholarship, so we created a fellowship model that allowed scholars to work with our production team in sustained collaborations. This process always began from the scholar's own desires and needs, that is, from the scholar's own perceptions about how technology and media might serve his or her research and its expression." At this time there are few humanities scholars interested in publishing rich multi-media "monographs" projects who scope, shape, and size are significantly bigger than a single author  journal size works. How much work constitutes a Vectors journal article? What would be the monograph equivalent?
	- "Harley and her colleagues detected a misfit between the reward structures within academe and more open or experimental forms of publishing. Put bluntly, they write, “There is no perceived reward for challenging the status quo.” The Regime of Accountability in all of its stagnent glory.
	- William Germano and the Two cultures, one of Data and the other of Narrative. Mcpherson sets this up as a false split.
	- "As the capacity to unfold narrative in new ways is honed, we will also discover that the relationship between database and narrative (or, one might say evidence and analysis) will also shift. This second order of the future book exists today in a variety of experiments. Some will fail, and others will become increasingly familiar." There is a strong thread of evolutionary thinking in McPherson's argument. Adapt or die.
	- "Some of those leading this experimentation will suffer for their innovations, riding ahead of the curve of their home disciplines and accepted practice. (Today, we see universities willing to hire the junior faculty to lead who are leading many of these changes but less willing to tenure them. Other universities set change into play but, impatient with the results, prematurely retreat.)" But sometimes the regime is far too strong.
	- "we need to evolve more “standardized” structures and interfaces that will allow us to delineate more stable genres and to scale multimodal scholarship. " I like this formulation that we are in a temporary period. If we think about this as a complex ecology, we have just shifted out of a  local equilibrium and now the system (or rather the elements within the system) evolve and adapt to find the new niches within the landscape (or the field).
	- Some of the niches: "One can begin to imagine new models for scholarly workflow in the humanities that engage a variety of stakeholders: archives and libraries, scholars and their professional societies, and university presses."
	- "This genre of digital scholarship complements the equally important urge to digitize, search, and catalog the human record undertaken by large‐scale digitization and archival efforts. While its impulse is to move beyond the encyclopedic toward new interpretive possibilities, it also represents a rich area for new collaborative and infrastructural possibilities for scholarly communication. " This echos Anne Blairs arguements about an archival ideology in Too Much To Know.
	- "Our initial research with scholars suggests that Scalar's incorporation of multiple views is particularly valuable for the analysis of primary archival and media materials. Scholars also responded quite positively to the ability to create branched analyses that push beyond the linearity of a typical webpage or blog. Nonetheless, they are understandably concerned about how this work with archival materials will circulate and how it will “count.” For the most part, they still view university presses as the best disseminator of their scholarship, and each recognizes that certain presses “register” within their fields in very particular ways, imparting both prestige and credibility while also managing peer review. Phil Pochoda has observed that the value of the book is “overdetermined” for most humanities scholars. [10] [#N10] The role of the press may be even more laden with meaning for them."
	- McPherson lists a series of question ("web of issues") that must be managed as we evolve our system of scholarly electronic publishing:
		-  "How is the acquisition process changed if scholars are creating their work within multimedia authoring platforms?"
		- "How will editorial functions and their temporalities shift if scholars are working in digital platforms to create their work?"	
		- "How will the design and production staff at a press need to adapt in order to support these new modes of working? " I am particularly interested in this one. Scholar Experience Design.
		- "If presses utilize a shared authoring platform, will each press create its own “look and feel” to brand their content or would a more universal look be preferable?" Distinction.
		- "How best to handle versioning?" Maybe we need to stop thinking about canonical versions and think about streams with Tagged releases. Look to the Open Source community for inspiration.
		- "What changes for peer review are necessary?
		- "How will the relationship to archives shift, resolve, or complicate intellectual property issues?"
		-"How might these emerging genres best be marketed and distributed?"
		-"How will each of these issues differ for journals vs. books?' For me this is the big question. Does the distinction between "journal" and "book" begin to break down as we adapt and accommodate these newly afforded publishing modalities?
	- "the questions unique to presses are only one part of the larger infrastructure that must shift and evolve as a system. Presses cannot run far ahead of the scholars who are their authors and readers, but neither will many scholars embrace digital publication if presses are not prepared to attend to this work with the care they have long given print books. Archives cannot become rich environments for virtual collaboration and experimentation if scholars cannot actually publish the work they might produce in these spaces and receive appropriate credit for their efforts. Reward structures within academe a university must also change if we are to create momentum for new kinds of work. This is not simply a matter of supporting “new fangled” modes of scholarship for the sake of technological glitz. Rather, it is a key element in the battle to save the humanities from potential obsolescence." Dealing with these issues becomes especially difficult because of the complex ecosystem within which they are situated. There is somewhat of a network-effect at play here, for any one of these issues to be solve, the entire complex ecosystem must change.

	- as I read the title and the abstract of this piece I am reminded of TK's presentation about the Archive Team and their efforts at Defcon TK. One of the interesting points he made during the presentation was how websites have dropped using the "under construction" animated gif. His reasoning for this was because in the modern web era, all websites are "under construction." A static website is a dead website. Everything is dynamic, blogs, tumblers, RSS, twitter feeds, Facebook walls, etc. Everything is constantly being updated because that is the only way to stay at the crest of the wave. In this dynamic age we have no need for an under construction gif because that is the normal expectation.
	- big question: how does a scholarly contribution that is un-ending and dynamic get peer reviewed or purchased at an institutional level?
	- there is a contradiction that has emerged, the distinction between "open" and "closed" has been conflated with "finished" and "unfinished." We valorize open and unfinished and demonized closed and finished. This is an interesting quadrant of analysis, especially if we think about visibility. Open and unfinished is visible in the raw (like this current document), open and finished is more akin to OER, closed and finished is the typical situation with most scholarly works. Closed and unfinished is nigh-invisible, we have no visibility to these scholarly objects until they are published. These are the file-drawer findings.
	-"I would submit that early in the 1990s the postmodern admiration of the "open-ended" at the expense of the "closed" somehow got turned into a celebration of the "unfinished" and a suspicion of the "done," and that this transmutation may have been one of the things that delayed the entrance of digital scholarship into the traditional system of peer-reviewed academic publication."
	- "Julia Flanders has observed in a memorable phrase that the digital humanities have sometimes suffered from "a culture of the perpetual prototype" [Flanders 2007], " Sewell goes on to draw a connection that "what was the postmodern project if not a cult of the perpetual prototype."
	- The finished/unfinished conundrum might be the crux of my visibility problem. How can something count if it is unfinished? How can something so technological pre-disposed to dynamicism, like a blog, ever be finished? 
	- paper then dives into a case study of several digital works produced by UVA press. in reference to these works "it is "done" when the Press is prepared to offer it for purchase and customers are prepared to buy it."
	- Three examples: 
		- digital imprints under the name Rotunda
		- Herman Miller's Typee
		- Papers of George Washington Digital Edition
 	- There is a nice analogy here to software development. Software is never done, but often it is "almost done." Zeno's paradox of software development.
	- "intrinsic criteria are used in both cases to determine when the project qualifies as finished, but as project 2 is formally undecidable (embodying the Turing halting problem that Matt Kirschenbaum mentions in his introduction), extrinsic criteria are also required to make the determination."
	- starting from the Turning halting problem (of which I am excited to see mentioned and am excited to see in Kirchembaum). sewell explores _intrinsic criteria_ and _extrinsic factors_. 
	- "Intrinsic criteria are formalist: they assume that the completeness of an object derives from its inner properties alone, without reference to any social or other external context"
	- there is a table that asks some nice questions and gives interesting examples
		- Object has definable boundaries (yes/no)
		- Object has satisfied its design goals (yes/no)
		- Print examples
		- digital examples
		- is it done?
		- from the combinatorial quadrant we get four categories 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
	- while intrinsic criteria are important, extrinsic factors generally trump. 
	- "scholarly discourse must be distributed in the form of discrete objects that can be shared, read or viewed, responded to, assimilated, quoted, disputed, and revised. In the marketplace of ideas, it's less important how you decide when your piece is done than that you do decide, label it and put it on display, and prepare to haggle with others over its value"

	- this is heavily focused on open access
	- "The British Academy was greatly concerned in 2005 about the impact of such trends and decline of the scholarly monograph:
	In the 1960s and 1970s, far fewer monographs were published than now, with routine global sales of 1500 or more. But these sales levels were not sustained, and a declining sales step-curve has been evident throughout the past quarter century, with a vicious circle of declining sales driving higher prices driving declining sales. Individual publishers have responded by issuing more and more individual titles, but with lower expectations of each. Global sales can now be as low as 250 or 300 in some fields. At some point in the 1990s, the UK academy ceased to be a self-sustaining monographic community: the subjects that have survived and/or thrived in this context have been those (like economics or linguistics or classics) with international appeal. (British Academy 2005)"
	- "In 2004 Blaise Cronin and Kathyrn La Barre surveyed major US universities and found that a scholarly monograph was still an essential prerequisite for promotion and tenure in those universities and highlighted the need for new measures of scholarly evaluation, other than simply the monograph publication itself. (Cronin and La Barre, 2004)"
	- "The Modern Language Association of America has regularly outlined its concerns on the scholarly monograph crisis and the need for new metrics to demonstrate scholarly value. (Modern Language Association 2006) “the vast majority of doctoral students in the social sciences and humanities will never see their theses published in traditional monographic form by university presses.”
	- "One of the major issues for getting E-press monographs accepted is faculty conservatism, for example, in terms of the use of print books for review purposes and the belief that electronic content is somehow less prestigious than its print equivalent. The restructuring by Columbia University Press of its Gutenberg-e monographs to open access has highlighted some of the structural issues in regard to faculty perceptions. (Howard 2008)"
	- good point about how the importance of the monograph is lost onSTM folks. "The early 2008 correspondence on the Liblicense and American Scientist email discussion lists have reflected a view by some correspondents that open access monographs are not part of the open access debate. Such comments typically come from those with an STM background who seem unaware of the importance of the book in the social sciences and humanities and the problems of the last two decades. The open access debate is about all disciplines and all scholarly publishing, not simply STM articles, and needs to be linked into university-wide missions of disseminating knowledge. (Thatcher 2007)"
	- "Cathrine Harboe-Ree, the librarian of Monash University, has provided an overview of the philosophies in the establishment of these e-presses. (Harboe-Ree 2007) This is not to say that librarians see themselves as publishers, nor to decry the difficulties that university presses face, but the library, in scholarly communication terms, is well placed to facilitate a wider distribution of university research." The library is becoming, it seems, an institutional umbrella that can provide cover for the changes occuring in scholarly publishing and scholarly communication. It seems that better understanding how these libraries are functioning as "trading zones"  (porter) or as "safe" fudging space (in the EM sense of the term) that allow radically transformitive practice to be enacted without being held back by traditional structures of accountability. Libraries and librarians, have been at the head of these technological catalyzed transformations for several decades. (recall dan klyn's anectote about how when people needed web-pages they turned to librarians.) Librarians and libraries are _incubators_.
	- "Sydney University Press (SUP), which was re-established by Sydney University in 2003 under library management, places the press within a wider perspective of e-scholarship in order to address the challenges of scholarly publication in the networked environment. SUP has a “hybrid production and philosophical approach to scholarly publishing ... expressed in terms of delivering both digital and print (on demand) content as appropriate, and a mix of open and paid delivery of publications”. (Coleman 2008)" Seems like a similar move to UofM with the formation of MPublishing.  
	- How many universities have migrated their presses into their libraries? How does institutional innovation transform the practices of publishing? Why was this necessary for the formation of the epress?
	- evaluating monographs via citation metrics is difficult "The assessment of research excellence through books, a key issue in the humanities and social sciences, is a neglected topic. In the monograph context the assessment of citations through databases such as Thomson's Web of Science is not a quick exercise due to the lack of automated source material. " and "books are typically not available electronically for citation purposes, and so must be searched manually for references. (Butler and Visser 2006)"

	- ebook use among librarians is complicated by the difficulty for both librarians and patrons to find and use ebooks. Also the acquisition of ebooks is complicated and librarians ars still uncomfortable purchasing digital over print books.
	- info seeking behavior of students & scholars re ebooks: they use public resources like google, yahoo, or amazon to find digital texts. They print if they can. They find library info systems to be confusing.
	- "Several themes consistently appear in the literature on the barriers to the adoption and integration of e-books into library collections, services, and systems. These include the lack of e-book and hardware standards; incompatible rights and operability; unrealistic price, purchase, and access models; and limited discovery and delivery options."
	- The basic gist here is that while ebook and digital distribution technology hold a lot of promise, they are still far to complicated due to lack of standardization (format & hardware), do to intellectual property confusion and because of difficulties purchasing and using ebooks. Essentially, the playing field for ebooks is far to challenging, especially for the non-power user. Until these complications are worked out, the advantages that ebooks afford cannot be worked out. This is especially troubling considering ebooks have been around for such a long time as evidenced by their telling of the history of ebooks.

	- So Blair is focusing mainly on reference works and note collections in early, pre-modern Europe. These genres help manage the ever-present "information management" challenges faced by the proliferation of books and texts made possible by the printing press (and other factors?). It is important to note however that these genres of text management had existed since the middle ages. 
	-"My purpose in studying reference tools in early modern Europe, and how they were conceived, produced, and used by contemporaries, is to gain insight into the ideals and practices of what one can anachronistically call “information management” in a period prior to our own."
	-"The perception of overload is best explained, therefore, not simply as the result of an objective state, but rather as the result of a coincidence of causal factors, including existing tools, cultural or personal expectations, and changes in the quantity or quality of information to be absorbed and managed."
	-"Nonetheless, the basic methods we deploy are largely similar to those devised centuries ago in early reference books. Early compilations involved various combinations of four crucial operations: *storing, sorting, selecting, and summarizing*, which I think of as the four S’s of text management." this might provide an interesting basis for a comparison between physical books and ebooks
	- the information explosion renaissance led to the emergence of new forms of text management, namely manuscript notes and reference works. 
	- the section in chapter one, "impacts of printing" is a nice description of the new textual forms afforded by the printing press as well as some commentary about their adoption.
	- Seneca represents the conservative tradition  - " [insert pithy quote]"too many books whereas Pliny the Elder represents the progressive tradition - "no book so bad" there is always something of value in every book

	- Don Tailor, a professor who blogs at theincidentaleconomist.com, recently wrote an "academic monograph" that he self-published using amazon's Kindle system in lieu of publishing with and academic press. His reasons for doing so related to the fact that his book, _Balancing the Budget is a Progressive Priority_, was extremely relevant to the debates and discussions about the debt ceiling that dominated political discourse in the summer of 2011. Had he gone with an academic publisher, the book would have come out in the summer of 2012, assuming everything went smoothly, nearly a year after the relevant policy debates that he was hoping the book would influence. So what did he do? He self-published the book on Amazon with some intentions to work with an academic press to publish a revised edition of the book (with some analysis of the outcome of the current policy debates).
	- This is a very interesting, and I suspect soon-to-be-frequent, occurrence for academics who what to publishtime-sensitive monographs. The current system is simply _too slow_ for certain kinds of works. This is not necessarily universally true, not every academic text is time sensitive in the way that Tailor's book was time sensitive, but I believe his argument and justification for the decision was sound. There is one interesting point he makes however, he said:
	 `I almost certainly would not have done this were I still an Assistant Professor who was still to be reviewed for tenure. However, I got tenure last year, so decided I would rather try and have my ideas have an impact and was therefore willing to risk getting less “academic credit.” Further, I am a professor in a School of Public Policy, and we claim to be interested in “policy engagement” so I decided to move ahead.`
Here is the power of tenure perpetuating itself within the sphere of scholars. Tenure decisions loom like a black cloud over any professor, regardless of if they have tenure or not. There are two interesting questions that fall out of this, first, how often do academics publish using amazon and second, for those who do, how many already have tenure?
	- This blog post is also interesting for another, much more banal reason, most of the post is dedicated to his account of the logistics of publishing using Amazon Direct Publishing. How much time did it take, how did formatting work, what was the submission process like, how did he reach his audience and promote his book, etc. These details are extremely interesting from a work-practice perspective because they make visible the ordinary work of publishing.  A very crude and brief review of his blog shows that his post about self-publishing logistics is one of the most popular (measured by  number of comments, I can't speculate about number of page views). Blog posts about "how to do X", especially if X is something new and not well understood are one surefire way to get readers. I found the post because it was linked to by one of the people I follow in my twitter feed (not Don Tailor). I suspect this post has been widely circulated, at least in the scholarly publishing circles in which I run.

	* This is the conference version of "On Technomethodology."  See notes below.
	* "The paradox of technomethodology lies in the attempt to design novel technological solutions based on an analytical perspective with a specific orientation towards the existing detail of practical action."
	* "rather than have systems design and ethnomethodology ‘reach' towards each other and ‘meet' at a design, we instead look to forge more foundational relationships, and then approach design from a new position. This foundational relationship is one in which design adopts the analytic mentality of ethnomethodology, and ethnomethodology dons the practical mantle of design. "

	* revisiting Technomethodology, operationalizing it.
	* "a socio-technical model of design that exploits the ethnomethodological notions of ‘breaching experiments' and consulting ‘perspicuous settings' to propel innovation in design. This model operationalises Button and Dourish's third way – i.e., it moves technomethodology on from reflecting on EM principles and insights to exploiting and developing them for the practical purposes of IT research. "
	* First Crabtree takes us into the philosophy of Husserl and the distinction between science, which never questions the possibility of objective truth vs philosophy which does. 
	* "Husserl is not denying objective knowledge and the achievements of the sciences – he is not entertaining the Sceptic or the Relativist - but asking what makes the transcendent achievements of the sciences possible?"
	* "The problem that Husserl has with this state of affairs is not the validity status of objective knowledge (again, that is for a community of practitioners to determine) but that the practical observability and practical objectivity of the objects of science is divorced from the “vital practices” whereby formal methods are made to work (ibid.). The practical observability and practical objectivity of the objects of the sciences is attributed to their formal workings instead. Thus, there is a foundational gap in our knowledge regarding the relation between knowing and the known object. A gap that consists of but ignores the vital (in the sense of being alive, enacted and essential) practices that provide for the production of objective knowledge: “the sources of knowing”, in Husserl's words (1999, Lecture IV).   "
	* Crabtree gives a nice explaination of the "pulsar paper" by Garfinkel, Lynch, and Livingston. He explains they show 5 things
	1. Their work "realized a plan in real time" but the "lived orderliness" was not dictated by the plan. The plan being in this case the ways by which they constructed the 
	2. "accountable object" - the pulsar is a real thing, but it transitioned from a "vague object-of-sorts" to a verifiable "object-that-is-actually-out-there-in-the-world" through the scientists sequences of talk.
	3. While it is not simply talk that constituted the reality of the object, it _is_ the talk that made the "observable structure of work" this the work made _visible_ which is a requirement for the mutual recognition of the object-that-is-actually-out-there-in-the-world.
	4. This visible and accountable work is by definition "according to plan" but it is _really_ constituted by the "reflexively produced and locally organized in and through concerted social interaction or cooperative work." But all of this is stripped away and we are left only with formal methods and discriptions.
	5. The object is constituted by and through the competence of the locally situated actors. Objects come to exist _for human beings_ as a result of human practice.
	* " This is not to say that such things as pulsars only exist as a result of human practice - that human practice casts and recasts the real world of things concrete. Rather, it is draw attention to what we already know but too often forget, namely that the real world of things concrete only exists for human beings as a result of human practice, and as practice changes so does our understanding of the real world of things concrete."
	* If knowledge is inextricably tied up with the practices that constitute that knowledge, then any attempt to change those practices potentially threatens the validity of the knowledge produced. There is no clean separation between practice and knowledge for the production and validation/verification of said knowledge is deeply situated. This is why a change in the technological practices of humanist knowledge projection is so paradoxical. How we come to "know" humanistic things is inter wined with how they are presented.
	* hybrid-program - takes the Ethnomethodological approach, which assumes the existence of a "missing interactional what" and foregrounds that work as the phenomenal object, as the things we study and the things we learn. "intention of the hybrid programme is clear: it is to inform the ongoing professional development of occupational practices whose workaday objects are under ‘praxiological' study (Garfinkel 1996)."
	* where the earlier Technomethodology article dug into the EM concept of "accounts" and advocated a design discipline that borrowed concepts from EM, this article takes more seriously the reality of that work which is _not_ accounted for and calls for it to be the central focus of the hybrid-discipline. Crabtree is going further than Dourish and Button in that he is asserting the "missing interactional what's" ontological reality, rather than analytically.
	* breaching experiments - "treating novel technical implementations as potter's objects, breaching experiments become both a means and resource providing for the exploration of potential technical futures through the explication of accountable structures of practical action made visible in the intertwining of people and computers." new technological objects, like art, reveal our assumptions. This is already happening in the humanities, "digital humanities" is like a big Garfinkelian breaching experiment envisioning a the future and pointing out that the emperor has no clothes. The question however is not how to learn to "see" but how can we change the underlying assumptions?
	* Crabtree uses the example of the Distributed Legible City installation that let people bike around "cities" in a virtual space. What he highlights through the conversations around the installation was that people invoked the "common background expectancies" of the city in the course of their conversations. They talked simply as if they were navigating around a city, not some strange virtual world made up of text. This was the "_scheme of interpretation_" deployed. "DLC was nevertheless oriented to by members of the public as a real world arrangement of urban space."
	* "the aim [of breaching experiments] is to explore the sociality of novel design spaces opened up through the deployment of novel technology configurations in real world situations of use." Digital humanities has breaching experiments in spades.
	* "design->real-world-deployment/breaching-experiment->study-of-perspicuous-setting->design" iterative process, ethnomethodology has come to play an active and constructive role in IT research, not by specifying requirements but by providing techniques and resources to explore and reason about the sociality of the design space."
	* "technology becomes a vehicle for social research, the results of which in turn propel innovation through technological exploration of social phenomenon initially seen in the breach and subsequently fleshed out through the consultation of perspicuous settings. " This seems to advocate a kind of "build it and see what happens" attitude, this had been tried before in DH. the key distinction here is that how you "see what happens" is very different. The participants must accept the EM assumptions about the "missing what" if they are going to extract any value from this kind of experiment. This begs a research question, does the "build it and see what happens" experiment bear fruit if it is conducted by EM informed folks vs non-EM folks? I.E. this with the proper professional vision. That seems to be what Crabtree is arguing here.
	* 	The Technomethodology method as described by Crabtree:
		1. Let designers build whatever they want with whomever they want, subject to their own constraints.
		2. Deploy the objects of design in real world settings.
		3. Treat deployment as a breaching experiment.
		4. Explicate the accountable structures of practical action made visible in the breach.
		5. Explore the topics identified in the breach through the study of perspicuous settings.
		6. Use the studies of perspicuous settings to flesh out abstract design concepts.
		7. Deploy the new design solution in real world settings and study its use.
		8. Repeat the process until the research agenda has been satisfied for all practical purposes.

	* "This approach takes as its starting point a relationship between ethnomethodology and system design which is a foundational, theoretical matter rather than simply one of design practice and process. From this foundation, we believe, emerges a new model of interaction with computer systems which is based on ethnomethodological perspectives on everyday human social action."
	* EM was incorporated into HCI, CSCW, and system design by Lucy Suchman. pointing out the failures of the cog psych models.
	* Fundamental challenge is how to meld Ethnomethodology with Design (namely system design)
	* three ways to inform design
		* "Learning from Ethnomethodologists" - no explicit EM. rather there is an ethno on the team who mediates between on-the-ground and the designers
		* "Learning from Ethnomethodological Accounts" - designers draw from EM accounts, written, of local situated practice. These accounts are input into design processes.
	* Two Paradoxes of Ethnomethodologically-informed design:
		* "the paradox of system design—that the introduction of technology designed to support “large-scale” ac-tivities while fundamentally transforming the “small-scale” detail of action can systematically un-dermine exactly the detailed features of working practice through which the “large-scale” activity is, in fact, accomplished. It points, fundamentally, to the interdependence of minute practice and grand accomplishment."
		* "the paradox of technomethodology. Given the concern with the particular, with detail, and with the moment-by-moment organisation of action, how can ethnomethodology be applied to the design of new tech-nologies?"
		* Technomethodological approach, reconsiders fundamental design principles through the lens of EM
			* Use the example of EM accounts as a way by which EM principles can be applied to system design. How can designers build systems which can account for its actions? Rendering visible certain activities while obscuring others behind abstractions.
	* CS abstractions are generative; are used in the manipulation of systems
	* EM abstractions are analytic; are in opposition to abstract "ideal types" from traditional sociology.
	* "Cohort Independence" - from Garfinkel & Sacks, "social phenomena that are not tied to the scenic features of their production" behaviors or patterns of behavior that transcend race, culture, occupational identity. they transcend "ideal types" and as such make those sociological abstractions less useful analytically. Focuses on everyday behavior not sociological generalizations.
	*  "technomethodology attempts to align system design not so much with the details of specific working practices, as with the details of the means by which such working practices arise and are constituted."

	- A consistent theme in many ethnomethodological studies of science is materiality–specifically the materiality of digagrams, images, proofs, floors–and the distinctly social relation between the materials and the participating individual(s). 
	- in "cultures of proving" Livingston gives an examples of this relation through a Gestalt image - the chalice or the two heads - "the see figure is not literally 'in' the physical object; the perception of either chalice or silhouetted heads goes beyond - or transcends - what retrospectively appears to be te material grounds of that percption."
	- Using examples from neuronal imaging Lynch shows how scientific data "were...neither wholly constructed, nor simply a 'mirror of nature' arising from an encounter between a rational mind and an inherently orderly nature. Instead, the representational adequacy of the data depended upon a tenuous coherence of actions established in the social environs of the laboratory."
