# What is a/the Digital Humanities?

The question, "what is the digital humanities" is extremely difficult to answer, which of course has attracted humanists to pontificate about it endlessly. Unlike the sciences, the humanities relishes in uncertainty [(Unsworth 2009)](http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/Cyberinfrastructure.RLG.html) for it is far more interesting than certainty. I suspect there will never be a clear answer because quiddity(what-ness) of the digital humanities is lost in a sea of haecceities(this-ness). What you will find below is my attempt to index the varied "this-ness" of the digital humanities. I make no claims at completeness, nor at done-ness. Instead, I encourage the patient reader to explore the various interlinked explorations of the literature and even return after a time for the content below is an ever-shifting stream.


## Scholarship in the Digital Age

The current momentum of the digital humanities is rooted in the slow, methodological plodding of humanities computing for the past 60 years.

It can't be denied that information technology is affecting the humanities and in the spirit of a postmodern pluralism we must recognize there are multiple ways of accounting for these changes. We can give primacy to one or another factor, the complexity of the changes probably extends beyond what is comprehensible. This complexity is precisely why the impact of technology on society and upon the humanities must be in and of itself a "humanistic” endeavor. Only humanists can fully appreciate and tease out the nuances of this complexity. (Unsworth 2009)

Infrastructure, or CyberInfrastructure (Atkins 2003) has unquestioningly been a topic of major importance in the sciences. "Big science" like the Large Hadron Collider have unprecedented instrument, sensor, computation, and network needs. National cyberinfrastructure in the US and eScience in Europe have been vital to the advancement of large scale scientific endeavors. Given the impact of cyberinfrastructure for the sciences, the question of cyberinfrastructure for the humanities is obvious.

<!-- ## Pedagogy

The tensions associated with the changes in the humanities are particularly visible in the structures of social reproducibility. If we are to worry about distortion of the humanities, then more attention should be spent considering what kinds of training, in terms of method, theory and practice, the next generation of (digital) humanists receives.

The debate amongst digital humanists about learning to program is fascinating. While I do not intend to do full justice to the debate, I will explore some recent discussion below. I am including this discussion because it raises some interesting questions about how the humanities is changing/distorting as a field and also the debate implicitly asks "what is being lost." Throughout the humanities infrastructure discussion are calls to include humanists because of the specific insights they can bring to the design of technology and infrastructure. I,  call this the 'humanist mystique' 

The full extent to which pedagogy is affected by the digital humanities covers a much larger spectrum than just the code debate and the humanist mystique. I am making no claims as to completeness. I include these two topics because of their relation to humanities infrastructure and, as I'll explore in the section on scholarship and dissemination, grey literature.

## Dissemination in the Digital Age

### His Dark Materials: Grey Literature<a href="/mcburton/writing/blob/master/chapter-one/Grey-Literature.markdown#grey-intro" name="grey-intro" >.</a>

One of the underlying promises of the digital humanities has been a re-evaluation of the boundary between formal scholarly publishing and informal scholarly communication. In my review of the digital humanities literature I would be remiss if I didn't pay attention to the so-called "grey literature," which has come to mean more than simply technical reports and white papers, but also blogging, list-serves and maybe even tweets. Most of the interesting discussion and debate about the digital humanities happens far too fast for the existing system of scholarly publishing.

### Multimodal Humanities 2.0<a href="/mcburton/writing/blob/master/chapter-one/Multimodal.markdown#multimodal-intro" name="multimodal-intro" >.</a>

<a href="/mcburton/writing/blob/master/chapter-one/Multimodal.markdown#multimodal-intro" name="multimodal-intro" >
Both Cathy Davidson (2008) and Tara McPherson (2009) have written that the digital humanities is something larger than the narrowly and rigidly defined notions that evolved out of humanities computing. Both treatments of the digital humanities expand its scope to connect with the existing "crises" in the academy, namely the crisis in the humanities and the criss in scholarly publishing.

<a href="/mcburton/writing/blob/master/chapter-one/Big-Tent.markdown#tent-intro" name="tent-intro" >
What has become painfully clear is that while digital humanities has its historical roots in humanities computing, as it has matured, it has become something far greater and more ambitious than humanities computing. From humble origins in automated concordances to harbinger of a Kuhnian paradigm shift, the full impact of the digital humanities has yet to be felt.

### From `Blaise_Pascal` to `Pascal (programming_language)`: The Humanities Quadrant<a href="/mcburton/writing/blob/master/chapter-one/Humanities-Quadrant.markdown#quadrant-intro" name="quadrant-intro" >.</a>

No good analysis would be complete without an analytical quadrant to frame the big picture. While reductionist and narrowly categorical, the quadrant helps us better understand the objects vs. methods debates. In light of the current chaos of the disciplines, it is useful as a map. Thusly, I present The Humanities Quadrant.

### Alternative Academics<a href="/mcburton/writing/blob/master/chapter-one/Alt-Ac.markdown#alt-ac-intro" name="quadrant-intro" >.</a>

<a href="/mcburton/writing/blob/master/chapter-one/Alt-Ac.markdown#quadrant-intro" name="alt-ac-intro" >
One of the most significant implications of the big-tent, activist digital humanities is the tearing down of the wall between academia and world of administrators, librarians, researchers, and others who orbit around the ivory tower. Given the its ever expanding activist agenda, it obvious that the "alternative academic" or "alt-ac" movement would find a home in the digital humanities. For the very question of "what is the digital humanities" naturally leads us to test the boundaries of the disciplines.

## Conclusion

So what then is "digital humanities?" It is an immuno response by the academic organism of the humanities, to a host of crises, some of which are directly or indirectly connected to broader technological change. We can think about the digital humanities as a multi-method, multi-modal, interdisciplinary domain focused on studying digital culture in the broadest of terms. Inside of this domain lives specific methodological thrusts, like humanities computing or common sets of research interests like new media studies.

For some time now I have been trying to organize my thoughts so that I may contribute to the cacophonous cloud of voices each shouting for a discursive perch in the ongoing debates and discussions in the digital humanities. With this I must preface, anything we may know or think we may know about the digital humanities will certainly change. The pace of these changes, both technological, but also sociological has reached an escape velocity of sorts, away from a grounding in traditional humanist academic practice and into an orbit of new heights. From this point where the digital humanities travels is something we can excitedly watch; we all have a ticket to ride.
