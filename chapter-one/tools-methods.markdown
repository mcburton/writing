# When all you have is a hammer: Tools & Methods


It can't be denied that information technology is affecting the humanities and in the spirit of a postmodern pluralism we must recognize there are multiple ways of accounting for these changes. We can give primacy to one or another factor, the complexity of the changes probably extends beyond what is comprehensible. This complexity is precisely why the impact of technology on society and upon the humanities must be in and of itself a "humanistic” endeavor. Only humanists can fully appreciate and tease out the nuances of this complexity. (Unsworth 2009)

Humanities computing explores the newly afforded possibilities for research in the humanities as a result of computation _as a tool_. As Unsworth puts it,
>"..one of the many things you can do with computers is something that I would call humanities computing, in which the computer is used as tool for modeling humanities data and our understanding of it, and that activity is entirely distinct from using the computer when it models the typewriter, or the telephone, or the phonograph, or any of the many other things it can be." (Unsworth 2002)


## An Origin Story
When writing and talking about the origin of the digital humanities, we can not and should not ignore the true visionary work of Father Roberto Busa. It was he who had the (divine?) insight in 1949 to contact TK? Watson at IBM to explore the possibilities of their new computation machine in the analysis of text.(Hockey 2004) What resulted was profound for multiple reasons. First, it was an attempt at a complete [lemmatization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatization) of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas, a task previously considered logistically impossible. Second, Busa's work with IBM demonstrated an entirely new horizon of possibility for humanist practice. Finally, as I explore below, it set a tone both in practice and discourse for the early era of the digital humanities.

The early discovery that computational technology could be brought to bear upon the the analysis of text has set a tone that has carried through to the current debates in the digital humanities. Within the pervasive "what is digital humanities" debates, one of the most problematic notions is that the digital humanities is solely focused upon tools, methodology, and text. (McPherson 2009) Outside of the tight-nit digital humanities community I believe this to be the case. The perception, which is by no means incorrect, is that digital humanities is simply humanities computing re-branded. ["I am not a programmer. I am not a coder. I haven't yet built any tools or significant models. Yet I consider myself a member of the community of digital humanities." says James Neal in a HASTAC blog post."](http://hastac.org/blogs/james3neal/2011/12/17/why-digital-humanities-community-and-networks) As I will address in my section on the [big-tent of digital humanities](big-tent.markdown), the literature reflects that the digital humanities has come to mean something more than code, tools, & models. But before I get ahead of myself, I should acknowledge the methodology narrative in the digital humanities.

## Methodology

In a blog post, "Sunset for Ideology, Sunrise for methodology?" Tom Scheinfeldt ponders, rather eloquently I might add, about a cycle of ideological vs. methodological domination within history and in the academy. Using the history of science as an example, he juxtaposed Sarton's scholarly contributions, " a journal (Isis), a professional society (the History of Science Society), a department (Harvard’s), a primer (his Introduction to the History of Science), and especially a bibliography (the Isis Cumulative Bibliography)" against those of his most famous student, Merton, the ideas of “Science, Technology and Society in Seventeenth Century England.” What Scheinfeldt is pointing out through his historical example is form of "scholarship" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries shifted. As he puts it "the consolidating and methodological activities of the teacher were giving way to the ideological and theoretical activities of the student."(Scheinfeldt 2008) 

Scheinfeldt goes on to draw a comparison between that historical period and our current era, albeit, with a shift in the opposite direction. Humanities computing / digital humanities, with its emphasis upon methodology creates a climate more akin to that of George Sarton than that of Robert K. Merton. "The new technology of the Internet has shifted the work of a rapidly growing number of scholars away from thinking big thoughts to forging new tools, methods, materials, techniques, and modes or work which will enable us to harness the still unwieldy, but obviously game-changing, information technologies now sitting on our desktops and in our pockets." 







"The humanities, in particular, has been without a galvanizing methodology for a generation now, and it is being, and will be, revolutionized by information technology as profoundly as any of the sciences..." (Unsworth 2009)

"Humanities computing is precisely the automation of every possible analysis of human expression (therefore, it is exquisitely a "humanistic" activity), in the widest sense of the word, from music to the theater, from design and painting to phonetics, but whose nucleus remains the discourse of written texts." (Busa 2004)

"digital humanities is a new set of practices, using new sets of technologies, to address research problems of the discipline"(Borgman 2009)

The perspective which considers the digital humanities concerned with tools and methods is not the only digital humanities. This perspective is essentially still humanities computing, their discursive shift in 2004 to the digital humanities was, in my opinion, unfortunate because it created confusion. What has emerged are two competing cultures for the discursive space we call digital humanities. On the one hand we have as I have just spoken about the historical trajectory of humanities computing, and only other hand we have a much broader conceptualization of digital humanities, the big tent digital humanities.

what is important is to not marginalize this humanities computing subset of the digital humanities. For we have to remember, historically, this is the oldest tradition, or perhaps the only tradition in the digital humanities. Furthermore, when thinking about the broader value proposition of the humanities in this era of the computational turn it into us humanists to have technical skills. The question of (computational literacy) [competition literacy] is both a fiercely debated topic, yet at the same time it can't be denied that these skills are extremely valuable.

We were talking about tools, code, methodologies, space specifically computational methodologies, I think it's best to instead of using the term digital humanities to use the term humanities computing. There's no argument about the definition or the boundaries of humanities computing. The use of computation in humanities research, for example computer-assisted analysis of literary texts or automated concordances, should be thought of as humanities computing when we are talking specifically about this kind of work. Now, humanities computing should also be considered a subset of the digital humanities. We can talk about the use of computational technology in digital humanities work, but we should not only consider that kind of work to be digital humanities work. This is the distinction between digital methods and digital objects which I see it is existing with in the digital humanities. Humanities computing  uses digital methods to study traditional humanist objects or rather digital representations of traditional subjects.
