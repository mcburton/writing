* Humanities Computing as a subset of Digital Humanities





** Institutionalization

One place to start answering questions about the digital humanities relationship within both the academy and the society is to look to the National Endowment for the Humanities new Office of the Digital Humanities. The institutionalization of the digital humanities has been recognized by many members of the community as a watershed moment (Kirschenbaum 2010, McPherson 2009). In many ways it represents a materialization of the digital humanities within the institutional social-infrastructure of the humanities as a whole. 

Interesting, I found Tom Schienfelds article about ideology and methodolgoy from a speech given by Brett Bobley...http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/odhfiles/Why.The.Digital.Humanities.pdf
"four major “game-changing” impacts of technology on the humanities: 
(1) The changing relationship between a scholar and the materials he studies; 
(2) The introduction of technology-based tools and methodologies; 
(3) The changing relationship among scholars, libraries, and publishers; and 
(4) The rise of collaborative, interdisciplinary work in the humanities."
