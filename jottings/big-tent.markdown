	** Enter "Big Tent" Digital Humanities

	The notion of "Big Tent" humanities emerged from the 2011 Digital Humanities conference at Stanford and was, in my opinion, brought into the wider conciousness by William Pannapacker's articles about his experience at the conference 'Big Tent Digital Humanities,' a View From the Edge, Part 1 and Part 2. 

	"Digital humanities is a comprehensive activist project that uses technology to respond to the interconnected cultural and structural problems of academe." He goes on "It redefines the nature of academic careers while dealing with longstanding disciplinary conversations. And it engages in complex, theoretical heavy lifting while building projects that are often based on the Internet, available to the public, and indisputably useful...Like the founders and builders of museums, libraries, concert halls, and critical editions in the last century, digital humanists are creating the new infrastructure of our history and culture and changing the nature of education and scholarship."



	As Kirschenbaum notes: 
	"Digital humanities has also, I would propose, lately been galvanized by a group of younger (or not so young) graduate students, faculty members (both tenure line and contingent), and other academic professionals who now wield the label “digital humanities” instrumentally amid an increasingly monstrous institutional terrain defined by declining public support for higher education, rising tuitions, shrinking endowments, the proliferation of distance education and the for- profit university, and, underlying it all, the conversion of full- time, tenure- track academic labor to a part- time adjunct workforce."




"at its core, then, digital humanities is more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even technologies....Yet digital humanities is also a social undertaking. It harbors networks of people who have been working together, sharing research, arguing, competing, and collaborating for many years. "(Kirschenbaum 2010) - to claim it is merely method is to cut off and isolate all of the social "work" that has emerged from the intersection of humanities and technology. It ignores the communicative change in favor of the computational change.

"Let me expand on what I mean by “digital humanities.” We use “digital humanities” as an umbrella term for a number of different activities that surround technology and humanities scholarship. Under the digital humanities rubric, I would include topics like open access to materials, intellectual property rights, tool development, digital libraries, data mining, born-digital preservation, multimedia publication, visualization, GIS, digital reconstruction, study of the impact of technology on numerous fields, technology for teaching and learning, sustainability models, and many others." (Bobley 2008 [http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/odhfiles/Why.The.Digital.Humanities.pdf])


Brett Bobley on Digital Humanities vs humanities computing - "seemed to cast a wider net than “humanities computing” which seemed to imply a form of computing, whereas “digital humanities” implied a form of humanism. I also thought it would be an easier sell to the humanities community to have the emphasis on “humanities.”(from Kirschenbaum 2010) It is important that a funding agency has taken a big tent approach to digital humanities rather than either adopt the name humanities computing (and its epistemological commitments) or a computationally focused approach to the digital humanities.


We can think about the digital humanities as a multi-method, multi-modal, interdisciplinary domain focused on studying digital culture in the broadest of terms. Inside of this domain lives specific methodological thrusts, like humanities computing or common sets of research interests like new media studies. At the end of the day, all study the "digital," even Father Busa was studying a new-media object, a digital model, or representation of text (Unsworth 2002). 

However, it is important to recognize that Busa was NOT studying digitally native objects,
 
If we can temporarily excuse my earlier comments about science envy, I think the internet is the large hadron collider of the digital humanities.
