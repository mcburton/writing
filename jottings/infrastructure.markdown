* Infrastructure

Considering the discursive cache' of "infrastructure" and especially "cyberinfrastructure" when talking about grand notions in the sciences and social sciences, it is no wonder some discussions in the digital humanities also engage this theme. My goal here is not to unpack how infrastructure is being used rhetorically in the digital humanities, nor to map the topology of infrastructural initiatives–of which there are many. Both of these are interesting studies in and of themselves and, at this moment in time, provide vital insight to the broader discussion. 


Compared to the sciences, the "humanities have little to no infrastructure." (Svensson 2011) This reality has triggered an 'infrastructual turn' in the humanities pinning its hopes and fears upon the digital humanities. The digital humanities is a natural home for the instrastructural discussion. Furthermore, perhaps contrary to Svensson's claim, Unsworth has posited humanities cyberinfrastructure already has a well established model in the Digital Humanities Centers (Unsworth 2007). 


Infrastructure in the digital humanities takes a variety of forms. 
	- Tools - Project Bamboo
	- Archives - Perseus, NINES
	- Laboratories / Collaboratories - HASTAC, Project Bamboo, NINES, CHNM, Scholars Lab, MITH (Unsworth 2007)

The infrastructure question for the digital humanities connects with a variety of other themes namely the code/builder/maker debates, questions of what counts as scholarship, and the call for a critical and self-reflective engagement of the digital humanities itself. 


Discussions of infrastructure in the digital humanities has raised a series of important questions for the future of digital humanities infrastructure.

*** Origins & Sustainability

"Dissatisfaction with its [COCOA] user interface coupled with the termination of support by the Atlas Laboratory, where it was written, led the British funding bodies to sponsor the development of a new program at Oxford University. Called the Oxford Concordance Program (OCP), this software was ready for distribution in 1982 and attracted interest around the world with users in many different countries (Hockey and Marriott 1979a, 1979b, 1979c, 1980). Other packaged or generic software also appeared at this time and significantly reduced the cost of a project in terms of programming support." COCOA and OCP might be the first "infrastructural" initiatives in humanities computing. That story also illustrates the complicated issues around software/tool sustainability. I think there is an interesting story to be told tracing the evolution of these tools. 



** Is Infrastructure Scholarship?

Jerome McGann, “Imagining What You Don’t Know: The Theoretical Goals Of The Rossetti Archive.”

Palmer (2004) asks the question, can a research collection be considered scholarship?


"A completely new idea for an electronic publication was developed by the Orlando Project, which is creating a History of British Women's Writing at the Universities of Alberta and Guelph....It was then possible to consider extracting portions of these documents and reconstituting them into new material, for example to generate chronologies for specific periods or topics. This project introduced the idea of a completely new form of scholarly writing."(Hockey 2004)


** Who Should Build Digital Humanities Infrastructure? 

A key theme that reverberates throughout the discussion about humanities infrastructure is the question of "who will build it?" The sentiment around this question has two flavors.

*** Humanists do it better:

-DH infrastructure needs those who do DH, not just developers, to build out infrastructure.(Borgman 2009)

- "Because we can make...a better infrastructure, if our perspectives, our training, and our expertise are included in its design and deployment." (Unsworth 2004)

Damon Horowitz tells us "Why you should quit your technology job and get a Ph.D. in the humanities" http://chronicle.com/article/From-Technologist-to/128231/

This trope has recently circulated in the popular sphere in Walter Issaccson's biography of Steve Jobs.
Steve Jobs biography - his humanities training led him to design better technology.

In general however, there is still a need for further evidence if the claim is true, that humanists do build better technology. What would "it" be about humanities training that leads to better design practice? 


Unsworth briefly chips in his two cents claiming, "[a]fter all, science—whose goal is predictive certainty—only has half the picture. Uncertainty (or ambiguity, if you prefer) is the other half, and the humanities and social sciences celebrate that, explore it, tolerate it, and understand it better than the sciences do. "(Unsworth 2004)

	"humanists have access to technology but are in search of questions: What scholarship becomes possible when, from their desktops, scholars can access vast stores of admittedly highly het-erogeneous data together with powerful capabilities for analysis and presentation?"
	infrastructure answers the "how" but humanities needs a research program to answer the "what" and "why" -"There exists an important but often-ignored distinction between the research programs that rely on an infrastructure and the research infrastructure itself." (Working together apart 2009) This echos the calls for "grand challenges" what are the big problems in the humanities? Of course isn't this a problematic question? Can any question ever be "solved" in the humanities, seems like there is an epistemological conflict here. Does (cyber)infrastructure, which is in itself a grand notion, imply grand narratives and grand challenges?
	
Wouldn't the humanities, being fully afflicted with The Postmodern Condition, react against the notion of "grand challenges" and "big humanities" 
	

	

***	To Code or Not To Code

Kirschenbaum weighed in at the Chronicle for Higher Education with a provocatively titled article "Hello Worlds: Why humanities students should learn to program"

The early "period [of humanities computing] also saw the introduction of courses on various aspects of humanities computing. Some courses were given by staff within academic computing centers and concentrated mostly on the mechanics of using specific software programs. Others looked more broadly at application areas. Those given by academics tended to concentrate on their own interests giving rise to student projects in the same application areas. A debate about whether or not students should learn computer programming was ongoing. Some felt that it replaced Latin as a "mental discipline" (Hockey 1986)."(Hockey 2004)
