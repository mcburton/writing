# What is a Digital Humanities?

One place to start answering questions about the digital humanities relationship within both the academy and the society is to look to the National Endowment for the Humanities new Office of the Digital Humanities. The institutionalization of the digital humanities has been recognized by many members of the community as a watershed moment (Kirschenbaum 2010, McPherson 2009). In many ways it represents a materialization of the digital humanities within the institutional social-infrastructure of the humanities as a whole. 

Interesting, I found Tom Schienfelds article about ideology and methodolgoy from a speech given by Brett Bobley...http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/odhfiles/Why.The.Digital.Humanities.pdf
"four major “game-changing” impacts of technology on the humanities: 
(1) The changing relationship between a scholar and the materials he studies; 
(2) The introduction of technology-based tools and methodologies; 
(3) The changing relationship among scholars, libraries, and publishers; and 
(4) The rise of collaborative, interdisciplinary work in the humanities."


## Computing Humanists: Humanities Computing

In an MLA report, Cathy Davidson situated the revolution in computational technology in the humanities as Humanities 1.0. Drawing upon Tim O'Reily's Web 1.0 / 2.0 distinction, Davidson argues humanities computing, which like web 1.0, was a first generational shift in the humanities instigated by technological change. This shift, Davidson claims–and I am inclined to agree–resulted in new research practice in the humanities. 
	>"Humanities 1.0— computational humanities—has changed the way we do research, the kinds of questions we can ask, and the depth, breadth, and detail of the answers we can provide to those questions" (Davidson 2008)
When drawn with respect to humanities computing, the scope of research practice does not appear to be a contested boundary. All agree that tools and methods in humanities research is squarely the domain of humanities computing. 

The discursive shift from humanities computing to digital humanities has been a significant moment in the evolution of the field (Svensson 2009, Unsworth 200?). In less than a decade, the digital humanities, not humanities computing, has risen to prominence as a significant cultural shift within the humanities. Tensions and contests emerge when attempts are made to define the digital humanities as simply a re-branded humanities computing. This tension arises from digital humanities coming to represent a much larger domain of practice than tools and methods. I will address full scope of the "big tent" of the digital humanities later, but for now I suggest it is useful to think of digital humanities as an amorphous super-set of a tightly defined humanities computing.

Humanities computing, both the term and the practice, have been with the humanities for a very long time. Yet, humanities computing scholarship has, by external measures, had dramatic impact upon the humanities community (Joula 2008). Joula attributes this to both a lack of incentive by traditional humanists, but also an inability to understand the work. For scholars versed in the methods of the traditional humanities, say for example close reading, the notion of statistical analysis of texts is not only foreign but glosses aspects of the text they deem most important. 

The humanities, which is celebrated by some as open to all methods and ideologies, should embrace, but also critically situate these "harder" methods and tools. Recent efforts like the [Praxis Program at the UVA Scholars Lab](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/) or books like the Oxford Companion to the Digital Humanities have begun to help alleviate the alien-ness of these methods. As I will explore further below, the questions of skills is a hotly debated topic, in part due to the porous boundary between humanities computing and the digital humanities. Specifically, the question of "should digital humanists know how to code" is a focal point of tension between the digital humanities and humanities computing.

### I want a Pink Pony: Cyberinfrastructure
<a href="Cyberinfrastructure#cyber-intro" name="#cyber-intro" >Infrastructure, or CyberInfrastructure (Atkins 2003) has unquestioningly been a topic of major importance in the sciences. "Big science" like the Large Hadron Collider have unprecedented instrument, sensor, computation, and network needs. National cyberinfrastructure in the US and eScience in Europe have been vital to the advancement of large scale scientific endeavors. Given the impact of cyberinfrastructure for the sciences, the question of cyberinfrastructure for the humanities is obvious.</a> 

	

## Pedagogy

The tensions associated with the changes in the humanities are particularly visible in the structures of social reproducibility. If we are to worry about distortion of the humanities, then more attention should be spent considering what kinds of training, in terms of method, theory and practice, the next generation of (digital) humanists receives.

The debate amongst digital humanists about learning to program is fascinating. While I do not intend to do full justice to the debate, I will explore some recent discussion below. I am including this discussion because it raises some interesting questions about how the humanities is changing/distorting as a field and also the debate implicitly asks "what is being lost." Throughout the humanities infrastructure discussion are calls to include humanists because of the specific insights they can bring to the design of technology and infrastructure. I,  call this the 'humanist mystique' 

The full extent to which pedagogy is affected by the digital humanities covers a much larger spectrum than just the code debate and the humanist mystique. I am making no claims as to completeness. I include these two topics because of their relation to humanities infrastructure and, as I'll explore in the section on scholarship and dissemination, grey literature.

## Conclusion

For some time now I have been trying to organize my thoughts so that I may contribute to the cacophonous cloud of voices each shouting for a discursive perch in the ongoing debates and discussions in the digital humanities. With this I must preface, anything we may know or think we may know about the digital humanities will certainly change. The pace of these changes, both technological, but also sociological has reached an escape velocity of sorts, away from a grounding in traditional humanist academic practice and into an orbit of new heights. From this point where the digital humanities travels is something we can excitedly watch; we all have a ticket to ride.
