* Humanities Computing as a subset of Digital Humanities


** Humanists Computing: Boys and their toys

In the course of my reading one thing became predominantly clear, where the digital humanities was broad, ambiguous and contested, the term humanities computing was not. 





In a blog post, "Sunset for Ideology, Sunrise for methodology?" Tom Scheinfeldt ponders, rather eloquently I might add, about a cycle of ideological vs. methodological domination within history and in the academy. Using the history of science as an example, he juxtaposed Sarton's scholarly contributions, " a journal (Isis), a professional society (the History of Science Society), a department (Harvard’s), a primer (his Introduction to the History of Science), and especially a bibliography (the Isis Cumulative Bibliography)" against those of his most famous student, Merton, the ideas of “Science, Technology and Society in Seventeenth Century England.” What Scheinfeldt is pointing out through his historical example is form of "scholarship" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries shifted. As he puts it "the consolidating and methodological activities of the teacher were giving way to the ideological and theoretical activities of the student."(Scheinfeldt 2008) 

Scheinfeldt goes on to draw a comparison between that historical period and our current era, albeit, with a shift in the opposite direction. Humanities computing / digital humanities, with its emphasis upon methodology creates a climate more akin to that of George Sarton than that of Robert K. Merton. "The new technology of the Internet has shifted the work of a rapidly growing number of scholars away from thinking big thoughts to forging new tools, methods, materials, techniques, and modes or work which will enable us to harness the still unwieldy, but obviously game-changing, information technologies now sitting on our desktops and in our pockets." 

The rhetoric of technology impacting methodology pervades throughout the literature. This makes sense if we think about the historical roots of humanities computing. Histories of HC/DH (Hockey 2004, Klien forthcoming) place the origin in 1949 with Father Roberto Busa's complete lemmatization of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas, the Index Thomisticus.

With an origin story solidly situated within computational linguistics, it is not difficult to see how humanities computing evolved a heavy focus upon methodology and text. 



"The humanities, in particular, has been without a galvanizing methodology for a generation now, and it is being, and will be, revolutionized by information technology as profoundly as any of the sciences..." (Unsworth 2009)

"Humanities computing is precisely the automation of every possible analysis of human expression (therefore, it is exquisitely a "humanistic" activity), in the widest sense of the word, from music to the theater, from design and painting to phonetics, but whose nucleus remains the discourse of written texts." (Busa 2004)

"digital humanities is a new set of practices, using new sets of technologies, to address research problems of the discipline"(Borgman 2009)

"at its core, then, digital humanities is more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even technologies....Yet digital humanities is also a social undertaking. It harbors networks of people who have been working together, sharing research, arguing, competing, and collaborating for many years. "(Kirschenbaum 2010) - to claim it is merely method is to cut off and isolate all of the social "work" that has emerged from the intersection of humanities and technology. It ignores the communicative change in favor of the computational change.

"Let me expand on what I mean by “digital humanities.” We use “digital humanities” as an umbrella term for a number of different activities that surround technology and humanities scholarship. Under the digital humanities rubric, I would include topics like open access to materials, intellectual property rights, tool development, digital libraries, data mining, born-digital preservation, multimedia publication, visualization, GIS, digital reconstruction, study of the impact of technology on numerous fields, technology for teaching and learning, sustainability models, and many others." (Bobley 2008 [http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/odhfiles/Why.The.Digital.Humanities.pdf])


*** A Culture of "Science"


"by its very nature, humanities computing has had to embrace "the two cultures", to bring the rigor and systematic unambiguous procedural methodologies characteristic of the sciences to address problems within the humanities that had hitherto been most often treated in a serendipitous fashion."(Hockey 2004)


[
Both Borgman and Unsworth (perhaps due to an iSchool influence?) both talk about humanities computing with a curious scientifical slant.
]
Borgman, drawing upon her groundbreaking analysis of scholarship in the digital age (2007), focuses specifically on the digital humanities, asking a series of questions. Her call to action asks 5 questions of the digital humanities:

"
What are Data?
What are the infrastructure requirements?
Where are the social studies of digital humanities?
What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century?
What is the value proposition for digital humanities in the era of declining budgets"
"

Underlying each of these questions is a potentially problematic assumption. This call to action implicitly places the humanities in comparison to the sciences. "Data", "infrastructure", "laboratories", "value propositions" these are the analytical building blocks of the social studies of science. Now it would obviously come as no surprise that Borgman, who comes out of science studies, would draw this comparison. Having come from science studies myself Borgman's call "Where are the social studies of digital humanities?" resonates with me. 

As I have been reading, thinking, and talking about the digital humanities I find drawing a connection between the (digital) humanities and the sciences to be dangerous rhetorical territory. Questioning humanities's "value proposition" takes us to questions about economic value in the broader societal context. The very metrics which have privileged the sciences for the past 60 years are the very same objects that have been problematized in the humanities (especially for the social studies of science).  Strong traditions of post-structuralist critique balk at the very question "What is the value proposition for the digital humanities..." although, perhaps at their own peril. 

Still, shrinking budgets are a reality and value propositions are the hammer to which policy makers render-into-nails the proposals crossing their desks. Does appearing or even becoming more "scientific"  behoove the (digital) humanities in the eyes of policy makers? What knowledge is gained or lost from this rhetoric and practice? How do (digital) humanists as an epistemic culture feel about such rhetoric and practice? What about the institutional support structure for humanities computing / digital humanities? 

** Institutionalization

One place to start answering questions about the digital humanities relationship within both the academy and the society is to look to the National Endowment for the Humanities new Office of the Digital Humanities. The institutionalization of the digital humanities has been recognized by many members of the community as a watershed moment (Kirschenbaum 2010, McPherson 2009). In many ways it represents a materialization of the digital humanities within the institutional social-infrastructure of the humanities as a whole. 

Interesting, I found Tom Schienfelds article about ideology and methodolgoy from a speech given by Brett Bobley...http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/odhfiles/Why.The.Digital.Humanities.pdf
"four major “game-changing” impacts of technology on the humanities: 
(1) The changing relationship between a scholar and the materials he studies; 
(2) The introduction of technology-based tools and methodologies; 
(3) The changing relationship among scholars, libraries, and publishers; and 
(4) The rise of collaborative, interdisciplinary work in the humanities."




[
Brett Bobley on Digital Humanities vs humanities computing - "seemed to cast a wider net than “humanities computing” which seemed to imply a form of computing, whereas “digital humanities” implied a form of human-ism. I also thought it would be an easier sell to the humanities community to have the emphasis on “humanities.”(from Kirschenbaum 2010) It is important that a funding agency has taken a big tent approach to digital humanities rather than either adopt the name humanities computing (and its epistemological commitments) or a computationally focused approach to the digital humanities.

McPherson (2009) also notes the significance of the Office of the Digital Humanities

** Enter "Big Tent" Digital Humanities

The notion of "Big Tent" humanities emerged from the 2011 Digital Humanities conference at Stanford and was, in my opinion, brought into the wider conciousness by William Pannapacker's articles about his experience at the conference 'Big Tent Digital Humanities,' a View From the Edge, Part 1 and Part 2. 

"Digital humanities is a comprehensive activist project that uses technology to respond to the interconnected cultural and structural problems of academe." He goes on "It redefines the nature of academic careers while dealing with longstanding disciplinary conversations. And it engages in complex, theoretical heavy lifting while building projects that are often based on the Internet, available to the public, and indisputably useful...Like the founders and builders of museums, libraries, concert halls, and critical editions in the last century, digital humanists are creating the new infrastructure of our history and culture and changing the nature of education and scholarship."



As Kirschenbaum notes: 
"Digital humanities has also, I would propose, lately been galvanized by a group of younger (or not so young) graduate students, faculty members (both tenure line and contingent), and other academic professionals who now wield the label “digital humanities” instrumentally amid an increasingly monstrous institutional terrain defined by declining public support for higher education, rising tuitions, shrinking endowments, the proliferation of distance education and the for- profit university, and, underlying it all, the conversion of full- time, tenure- track academic labor to a part- time adjunct workforce."
