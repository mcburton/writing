No good analysis would be complete without an analytical quadrant to frame the big picture. It is perhaps reductionist and categorical, but in light of the current chaos of the disciplines, a quadrant juxtaposing digital methods vs. digital objects is useful as a map. Thusly, I present The Humanities Quadrant.

The delegation of the so called "traditional humanities" to the lower left square of the quadrant is by no means a minimization of salience. Nor am I seriously implying there is no relation between the traditional humanities and the rest of the square. But this quadrant needs to be here, as an other, because the discussions about humanities computing and the digital humanities often define themselves in relation to a mythical "traditional humanities." Somewhere, a humanist still scours paper archives, jotting down notes on their yellow pad to write up on their typewriter in the form of a 300 page monograph to be mailed to a university press. Obviously, digital methods and objects have leaked into even the most traditional of humanities scholar's practice, but the point remains, humanities computing and the digital humanities see themselves as something distinct and new from the traditional humanities. 

Computational linguistics, computer assisted textual analysis, spatial history, modeling, without computation would be logistically or practically impossible; they are digitally native in the methodological sense. Digitally native methods are those historically associated with humanities computing. Father Busa's Index Thomisticus or Willard McCarty's work "Finding Implicit Patterns in Ovid's Metamorphoses with TACT" (McCarty 1996) would both fit squarely in the upper left quadrant. Now the objects used by humanities computing are obviously digital, but they are also indexical to an analog form. They are models or representations (which one could argue are digitally native) of existing (usually textual) research objects (Unsworth 2002). 

The bottom right of the quadrant, the use of traditional methods to study digitally native objects, is as I have shown, a newcomer to the big tent. The arrival of this quadrent from domains like new media studies, critical theory and TK was met with some consternation from the humanities computing folks who, with the name change in the oxford companion, had tried to claim the territory for themselves (Svensson 2009).  This community has an uneasy relationship with the monkier "digital humanities." Note a recent faculty search and cluster hire at the University of Michigan was dubbed "digital environments" instead of "digital humanities." Furthermore, those hired study digitally native objects (Spam, Algorithms, Flash media, networks) but do not necessarily deploy digitally native methodologies.  At the same time, communities like HASTAC have very boldly staked their claim, the study of digitally native objects, regardless of methodology, belongs in the big tent digital humanities. 

This leaves the final quadrant in my diagram, the folks who study digitally native objects using digitally native methods. This, curiously, seems to me to be the smallest of the four quadrants. This kind of research, natural language processing of blogs, or spatial analysis of tweets, is common in the social sciences, but this style of work in the humanities is, at least from my perspective, quite uncommon. I suspect, if I were to survey the digital humanities graduate student population I might find more examples of this work, but in the digital humanities today I see very little of it. Where are the computer assisted textual analyses of blogs, or the spatial history of tweets? The interpretivist social sciences are going to be the place to find this work. 

One glaring omission from this quadrant is the social infrastructure of alt-ac. The humanist quadrant privileges traditional notions of scholarly "work" at the expense of others. We need to explore another dimension of this analytical diagram, one that plunges into the depths of the "invisible work" (Star & Strauss) by administrators, librarians, temporary researchers, and graduate students. This invisible work, which has been so exhaustively studied in the sciences (Burton & Jackson 2012, Star & Ruhleder 1996, Shapin 1988, Collins ???), has yet to be conducted in the humanities and digital humanities. If, as the rhetoric of the "big tent" will lead us to believe, the digital humanities is inclusive then we must find how how much "work" is truly made visible. In the spirit of Bowker's "Memory Practices of the Sciences" (2006) we need a "Memory Practices of the Humanities."
