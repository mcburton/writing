** Visibility 

> "Whatever else it might be then, the digital humanities today is about a scholarship (and a pedagogy) that is publicly visible in ways to which we are generally unaccustomed, a scholarship and pedagogy that are bound up with infrastructure in ways that are deeper and more explicit than we are generally accustomed to, a scholarship and pedagogy that are collaborative and depend on networks of people and that live an active 24/7 life online."


*** Blogs
	Within the (digital) humanities blogs occupy this strange space 

*** Twitter

"the incessant Twittering is a lot to keep up with, like being nibbled to death by ducks, and yet it seems like thatâ€™s where the action is" (Pannapacker 2011 - DH triumphant)
	No serious inspection of the digital humanities could be complete without some consideration of the role twitter has formed in the late formation of digital humanities as a community of practice / epistemic culture. 
	
Just today as I am writing these words @brettbobley tweets "Welcome William @pannapacker of the Chronicle to Twitter." to which @pannapacker responds "@brettbobley Thank you, Brett."

* Is Infrastructure Scholarship?




Palmer (2004) asks the question, can a research collection be considered scholarship?


> "A completely new idea for an electronic publication was developed by the Orlando Project, which is creating a History of British Women's Writing at the Universities of Alberta and Guelph....It was then possible to consider extracting portions of these documents and reconstituting them into new material, for example to generate chronologies for specific periods or topics. This project introduced the idea of a completely new form of scholarly writing."(Hockey 2004)
