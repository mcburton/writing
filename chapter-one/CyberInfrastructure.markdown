Infrastructure, or CyberInfrastructure (Atkins 2003) has unquestioningly been a topic of major importance in the sciences. "Big science" like the Large Hadron Collider have unprecedented instrument, sensor, computation, and network needs. National cyberinfrastructure in the US and eScience in Europe have been vital to the advancement of large scale scientific endeavors. Given the impact of cyberinfrastructure for the sciences, the question of cyberinfrastructure for the humanities is obvious.

Compared to the sciences, the "humanities have little to no infrastructure" (Svensson 2011). In some senses, this is true. There has been little concerted efforts towards a unified program for cyberinfrastructure in the humanities. This reality has triggered an 'infrastructual turn' in the humanities. The urgency for the humanities to be a part of the infrastructure discussion can be felt in this era of information overload. 
> "As more personal, social, and professional time is spent online, it will become increasingly important to have an online environment that cultivates the richness of human experience, the diversity of human languages and cultures, and the full range of human creativity. Such an environment will best emerge if its design can benefit from the strengths of the humanities and social sciences: clarity of expression, the ability to uncover meaning even in scattered or garbled information, and centuries of experience in organizing knowledge. These strengths are especially important as the volume of digital resources grows, as complexity increases, and as we struggle to preserve and make sense of billions of sources of information." (ACLS 2006) 

At the risk of evoking science envy(more below), I think there is a productive analogy to be made between the sciences and the humanities. The internet is the large hadron collider of the digital humanities. The net provides a baseline infrastructure, which humanists can leverage to study human culture. To abuse the analogy even further, it is a shared infrastructure, used diverse group of scholarly people to upon the "grand challenge" to understand the impact technology has had, and is having, upon our global society. 


### National Cyberinfrastructure

In 2006, the American Council for Learned Societies Commission on CyberInfrastructure issued their report, Our Cultural Commonwealth, o

 From the Arts & Humanities Act of 1965 "(3) An advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone, but must give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future. ...(4) Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens. It must therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make people of all back-grounds and wherever located masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants." 

If we take for granted the assumption of the 1965 Act, which to be clear I would argue we should, then our collective societal understanding of resent technological change would be informed by the humanities academic community. To enable the humanities in that endeavor, the report argues for a "leveraged, coordinated investment" in humanities cyberinfrastructure. As of the writing of the report, there has been no coordinated efforts like those in the sciences, in humanities cyberinfrastructure. This is not to say there have not been substantial efforts in the development of humanities infrastructure. There is a long history of challenges in sustaining humanities computing infrastructure (Hockey 2004), early projects like COCOA or the Oxford concordance program suffered from loss of institutional support to rapidly changing technological ecosystems (Hockey 2004).  As the ACLS report identifies institutional stability necessary to sustain humanities cyberinfrastructure must not only be fiscal, it must also be intellectual. Only through the passionate attention of sufficient human capital can a national effort towards humanities cyberinfrastructure succeed. 


### Science Envy?

Borgman, drawing upon her groundbreaking analysis of scholarship in the digital age (2007), focuses specifically on the digital humanities, asking a series of questions. Her call to action asks 5 questions of the digital humanities:

* What are Data?
* What are the infrastructure requirements?
* Where are the social studies of digital humanities?
* What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century?
* What is the value proposition for digital humanities in the era of declining budgets"


Underlying each of these questions is a potentially problematic comparison. This call to action implicitly places the humanities in relation to the sciences. "Data", "infrastructure", "laboratories", "value propositions" these are the analytical building blocks of the social studies of science. Now it would obviously come as no surprise that Borgman, who comes out of science studies, would draw this comparison. Having come from science studies myself Borgman's call "Where are the social studies of digital humanities?" resonates with me. 

As I have been reading, thinking, and talking about the digital humanities I find drawing a connection between the (digital) humanities and the sciences to be dangerous rhetorical territory. Questioning humanities's "value proposition" takes us to questions about economic value in the broader societal context. The very metrics which have privileged the sciences for the past 60 years are the very same objects that have been problematized in the humanities (especially for the social studies of science).  Strong traditions of post-structuralist critique balk at the very question "What is the value proposition for the digital humanities..." although, perhaps at their own peril. 

Still, shrinking budgets are a reality and value propositions are the hammer to which policy makers render-into-nails the proposals crossing their desks. Does appearing or even becoming more "scientific"  behoove the (digital) humanities in the eyes of policy makers? What knowledge is gained or lost from this rhetoric and practice? How do (digital) humanists as an epistemic culture feel about such rhetoric and practice? What about the institutional support structure for humanities computing / digital humanities? 


### A Diverse Notion Infrastructure

Perhaps contrary to Svensson's claim, Unsworth has posited humanities cyberinfrastructure already has a well established model in the Digital Humanities Centers (Unsworth 2007). Digital humanities research centers like Scholars Lab at UVA, the Center for History and New Media at George Mason, and MITH at the University of Maryland  provide living examples of new kinds of infrastructure. The success of existing centers provides a model for other universities and cultural institutions to follow. Beyond individual centers, organizations like [centerNet](http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/), the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations](http://digitalhumanities.org/), and the [Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes](http://www.arts-humanities.net/chain/) have emerged, merged, and associated into a rich interconnected fabric to support the humanities and digital humanities in the digital age. 

Existing cyberinfrastructure in the digital humanities takes a variety of forms. Taken broadly there are a variety of resources available to humanities scholars. 
	- Tools : Project Bamboo
	- Archives / Digital : Perseus, NINES
	- Laboratories / Centers : HASTAC, CHNM, Scholars Lab, MITH
Cyberinfrastructure, as defined in the Akins report and re-enforced by Our Cultural Commonwealth is "more than a tangible network and means of storage in digitized form, and it is not only discipline-specific software applications and project-specific data collections. It is also the more intangible layer of expertise and the best practices, standards, tools, collections and collaborative environments that can be broadly shared across communities of inquiry (McGann 2010)." The digital humanities centers like the Center for History and New Media have been vital to the recent developments of digital humanities infrastructure. Without the support of infrastructural centers, many digital humanities projects would never get off the ground (Muri 2010). They provide an institutional umbrella, a funding mechanism, and the oft-neglected project management resources that many academic initiatives sorely lack.

However, the motley assemblage of tools, archives and centers does not represent a coherent cyberinfrastructure like the vision from Our Cultural Commonwealth, moreover they do not have broad mind-share.
>"	Funding agents like NEH , SSHRC, and Mellon have thrown support to individual scholars and small groups of scholars, and they have encouraged new institutional agents like Ithaka, Hastac, SCI, and Bamboo. But while these developments have increased during the past seventeen years—i.e., since the public emergence of the Internet—the scholarly community at large remains shockingly passive." (McGann 2010)
One of the massive gaps I have noticed in cyberinfrastructure for the digital humanities is not data centers or high speed networks, but rather the pedagogical infrastructure to enable the digital humanities "social reproducibility." In his history of Cybernetics, Andrew Pickering noted that while cybernetics was met with great enthusiasm in the late 50s (as digital humanities is today), graduate programs to train the next generation of cyberneticians never stabilized. While the multitude of digital humanities centers, programmatic infrastructure projects, and massive archival efforts are provide an institutional, technical, and archival baseline for the digital humanities, the pedagogical infrastructure needs to be put into place. There are some efforts, many at the [masters degree level](http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/is-there-a-list-anywhere-of-all-the-graduate-programs-that-study-dh), but it remains an open question as to what academic unit digital humanities will find a home. Matt Kirschenbaum has staked a claim for english departments (2010), but that only reinforces the assumption that the main focal object of the digital humanities is text (McPherson 2009).

It is vitally important to keep in mind that when thinking about infrastructure, the broader humanities community is not part of the conversation. With all of its enthusiasm and attention, we must remember the digital humanities represents a small portion of the humanities. While the digital humanities is a natural home for a humanities infrastructure discussion, we must also consider how proscriptive the design and implementation of digital humanities influenced infrastructure will have upon the wider humanities community. As McGann warns us, "[i]nfrastructure can distort the field and alter the ecology of a field." (2010) Infrastructure is a technical embodiment of our assumptions (Star & Ruhleder 1996, Star 1999). We build technical systems to fulfill the idealized ways in which we believe the world (even so-called "user centric" design strategies, when was the last time you called the chair of the english department a "user?").
