## What is this?
Some folks might end up here who don't already know what this is. This is my field prelim, it is an extensive literature review of a topic (or set of topics) and a design for a research project. I am a graduate student at the [School of Information at the University of Michigan](https://si.umich.edu). 

This is an experiment. While writing using revision control, git and github is not actually that new of a phenomena in the tech circles, this _is_ a radical departure from the traditional working habits of humanitarian scholars. Since I was once upon a time a computer programmer AND I like to write code, this writing structure is an effort to trick my brain into enjoying the writing process. Beyond the structural experimentation, I am also being *extremely* open about the writing process. _EVERYTHING IS PUBLIC._ There are no private files in this project. Since there is no "data" associated with this particular project, the whole privacy and disclosure problem becomes less complicated. As I write, I will commit the changes to this repository. This means that <strike>some</strike>most of the writing here will be pretty raw. DEAL WITH IT.

Please feel free to fork, modify and make pull requests to this work. If you have no idea what the hell I just said just email me.

This github repository will be used for sharing, collaboration and tracking my progress.
