== What is this?
Some folks might end up here who don't already know what this is. This is my field prelim, it is an extensive literature review of a topic (or set of topics) and a proposal for a research project. I am a graduate student at the https://si.umich.edu[School of Information at the University of Michigan]. 

This github repository will be used for sharing, collaboration and tracking my progress.
