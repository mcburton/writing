# When all you have is a hammer: Tools & Methods


## The Origin Story
	[busa as a shot across the bow of what we knew is possible. ] 
When writing and talking about the origin of the digital humanities, we can not and should not ignore the true visionary work of Father Roberto Busa. It was he who had the (divine?) insight in 1949 to contact TK? Watson at IBM to explore the possibilities of their new computation machine in the analysis of text.(Hockey 2004) What resulted was profound for multiple reasons. First, it was an attempt at a complete [lemmatization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatization) of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas, a task previously considered logistically impossible. Second, Busa's work with IBM demonstrated an entirely new horizon of possibility for humanist practice. Finally, as I explore below, it set a tone both in practice and discourse for the early era of the digital humanities.

The early discovery that computational technology could be brought to bear upon the the analysis of text has set a tone that has carried through to the current debates in the digital humanities. Within the pervasive "what is digital humanities" debates, one of the most problematic notions is that the digital humanities is solely focused upon tools, methodology, and text. (McPherson 2009, )


In a blog post, "Sunset for Ideology, Sunrise for methodology?" Tom Scheinfeldt ponders, rather eloquently I might add, about a cycle of ideological vs. methodological domination within history and in the academy. Using the history of science as an example, he juxtaposed Sarton's scholarly contributions, " a journal (Isis), a professional society (the History of Science Society), a department (Harvard’s), a primer (his Introduction to the History of Science), and especially a bibliography (the Isis Cumulative Bibliography)" against those of his most famous student, Merton, the ideas of “Science, Technology and Society in Seventeenth Century England.” What Scheinfeldt is pointing out through his historical example is form of "scholarship" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries shifted. As he puts it "the consolidating and methodological activities of the teacher were giving way to the ideological and theoretical activities of the student."(Scheinfeldt 2008) 

Scheinfeldt goes on to draw a comparison between that historical period and our current era, albeit, with a shift in the opposite direction. Humanities computing / digital humanities, with its emphasis upon methodology creates a climate more akin to that of George Sarton than that of Robert K. Merton. "The new technology of the Internet has shifted the work of a rapidly growing number of scholars away from thinking big thoughts to forging new tools, methods, materials, techniques, and modes or work which will enable us to harness the still unwieldy, but obviously game-changing, information technologies now sitting on our desktops and in our pockets." 

The rhetoric of technology impacting methodology pervades throughout the literature. This makes sense if we think about the historical roots of humanities computing. Histories of HC/DH (Hockey 2004, Klien forthcoming) place the origin in 1949 with Father Roberto Busa's complete lemmatization of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas, the Index Thomisticus.

With an origin story solidly situated within computational linguistics, it is not difficult to see how humanities computing evolved a heavy focus upon methodology and text. 



"The humanities, in particular, has been without a galvanizing methodology for a generation now, and it is being, and will be, revolutionized by information technology as profoundly as any of the sciences..." (Unsworth 2009)

"Humanities computing is precisely the automation of every possible analysis of human expression (therefore, it is exquisitely a "humanistic" activity), in the widest sense of the word, from music to the theater, from design and painting to phonetics, but whose nucleus remains the discourse of written texts." (Busa 2004)

"digital humanities is a new set of practices, using new sets of technologies, to address research problems of the discipline"(Borgman 2009)
