# What is a Digital Humanities?

One place to start answering questions about the digital humanities relationship within both the academy and the society is to look to the National Endowment for the Humanities new Office of the Digital Humanities. The institutionalization of the digital humanities has been recognized by many members of the community as a watershed moment (Kirschenbaum 2010, McPherson 2009). In many ways it represents a materialization of the digital humanities within the institutional social-infrastructure of the humanities as a whole. 

Interesting, I found Tom Schienfelds article about ideology and methodolgoy from a speech given by Brett Bobley...http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/odhfiles/Why.The.Digital.Humanities.pdf
"four major “game-changing” impacts of technology on the humanities: 
(1) The changing relationship between a scholar and the materials he studies; 
(2) The introduction of technology-based tools and methodologies; 
(3) The changing relationship among scholars, libraries, and publishers; and 
(4) The rise of collaborative, interdisciplinary work in the humanities."

## Computing Humanists: Humanities Computing

The current momentum for the digital humanities is rooted in the slow, but steady, velocity of humanities computing.

### When all you have is a hammer: Tools & Methods

It can't be denied that information technology is affecting the humanities and in the spirit of a postmodern pluralism we must recognize there are multiple ways of accounting for these changes. We can give primacy to one or another factor, the complexity of the changes probably extends beyond what is comprehensible. This complexity is precisely why the impact of technology on society and upon the humanities must be in and of itself a "humanistic” endeavor. Only humanists can fully appreciate and tease out the nuances of this complexity. (Unsworth 2009)
	
### I want a Pink Pony: Cyberinfrastructure

<a href="/mcburton/writing/blob/master/chapter-one/CyberInfrastructure.markdown#cyber-intro" name="cyber-intro" >
Infrastructure, or CyberInfrastructure (Atkins 2003) has unquestioningly been a topic of major importance in the sciences. "Big science" like the Large Hadron Collider have unprecedented instrument, sensor, computation, and network needs. National cyberinfrastructure in the US and eScience in Europe have been vital to the advancement of large scale scientific endeavors. Given the impact of cyberinfrastructure for the sciences, the question of cyberinfrastructure for the humanities is obvious.

## Pedagogy

<a href="/mcburton/writing/blob/master/chapter-one/Pedagogy.markdown#pedagogy-intro" name="pedagogy-intro" >
The tensions associated with the changes in the humanities are particularly visible in the structures of social reproducibility. If we are to worry about distortion of the humanities, then more attention should be spent considering what kinds of training, in terms of method, theory and practice, the next generation of (digital) humanists receives.

### Multimodal Humanities 2.0

Both Cathy Davidson (2008) and Tara McPherson (2009) have written that the digital humanities is something larger than the narrowly and rigidly defined notions that evolved out of humanities computing. Both treatments of the digital humanities expand its scope to connect with the existing "crises" in the academy, namely the crisis in the humanities and the criss in scholarly publishing.

### From [Blaise_Pascal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal) to [Pascal (programming_language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)): The Humanities Quadrant

No good analysis would be complete without an analytical quadrant to frame the big picture. It is perhaps reductionist and categorical, but in light of the current chaos of the disciplines, a quadrant juxtaposing digital methods vs. digital objects is useful as a map. Thusly, I present The Humanities Quadrant.

## Conclusion

For some time now I have been trying to organize my thoughts so that I may contribute to the cacophonous cloud of voices each shouting for a discursive perch in the ongoing debates and discussions in the digital humanities. With this I must preface, anything we may know or think we may know about the digital humanities will certainly change. The pace of these changes, both technological, but also sociological has reached an escape velocity of sorts, away from a grounding in traditional humanist academic practice and into an orbit of new heights. From this point where the digital humanities travels is something we can excitedly watch; we all have a ticket to ride.
