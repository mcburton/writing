# Bring in the Clowns: Big Tent Digital Humanities
	
	
"Let me expand on what I mean by “digital humanities.” We use “digital humanities” as an umbrella term for a number of different activities that surround technology and humanities scholarship. Under the digital humanities rubric, I would include topics like open access to materials, intellectual property rights, tool development, digital libraries, data mining, born-digital preservation, multimedia publication, visualization, GIS, digital reconstruction, study of the impact of technology on numerous fields, technology for teaching and learning, sustainability models, and many others." (Bobley 2008 [http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/odhfiles/Why.The.Digital.Humanities.pdf])


Brett Bobley on Digital Humanities vs humanities computing - "seemed to cast a wider net than “humanities computing” which seemed to imply a form of computing, whereas “digital humanities” implied a form of humanism. I also thought it would be an easier sell to the humanities community to have the emphasis on “humanities.”(from Kirschenbaum 2010) It is important that a funding agency has taken a big tent approach to digital humanities rather than either adopt the name humanities computing (and its epistemological commitments) or a computationally focused approach to the digital humanities.




In the first two of his four part series on the digital humanities, Patrick Svensson explores the relation between the humanities and information technology. The articles provide both a deep and broad analysis of the field as a whole, exploring its historical roots in humanities compuing, the discursive shift towards digital humanities, and the ongoing expansion into a multimodel second-wave of "humanities 2.0." 

Svensson notes the "digital humanities comprise a field in a loose sense...an inclusive notion that will allow us to talk about different kinds of initiatives and activities in the intersection between the humanities and information technology or the digital." (Svensson 2009) This is an important observation, for it highlights the digital humanities is more a _conversation_ and a common social object enabling solidarity in a sea of quiddity.
>"at its core, then, digital humanities is more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even technologies....Yet digital humanities is also a social undertaking. It harbors networks of people who have been working together, sharing research, arguing, competing, and collaborating for many years. "(Kirschenbaum 2010)

To claim the digital humanities is merely method cuts off and isolates the social "work" emerging from the the socio-technical edge of the humanities. It ignores the legitimate peripheral participation (cite) of workers and work that has historically been at the margins of the academy (it is also perhaps doubly ironic because humanities computing had been marginalized as well). Digital humanities, as I'll discuss below, has become much more inclusive to participation from those who would not normally be considered traditional academics, both in their practice (multimodal scholars) and in their institutional home (alternative academics).


## Multimodal Humanities 2.0

Both Cathy Davidson (2008) and Tara McPherson (2009) have written that the digital humanities is something larger than the narrowly and rigidly defined notions that evolved out of humanities computing. Both treatments of the digital humanities expand its scope to connect with the existing "crises" in the academy, namely the crisis in the humanities and the criss in scholarly publishing. 

Cathy Davidson situates the digital humanities within the existing "crisis in the humanities" and the relationship between the humanities and the sciences. 
>"The so-called crisis in the humanities is nothing new. Even in The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution (1959), C. P. Snow was already lamenting that “thirty years ago the cultures had long ceased to speak to each other” and blamed the bifurcation in part on the devaluing of humanists: “young scientists" now feel that they are part of a culture on the rise,” while humanists feel their worth “in retreat” (18, 19)"

Crisis precipitates change. Rather than retreat, Davidson wants the digital humanities to become a rallying point for change not only in research questions and methods but also in the way teach, what we teach, our intellectual products, our systems of promotion & credentialing, and the very foundations of humanities social institution. This vision of the digital humanities is fundamentally different, but very much related to, humanities computing. As I mentioned elsewhere, Davidson considers humanities computing to be humanities 1.0 (although I'm not sure what then the traditional humanities might be, humanities 0.0?), the digital humanities with its revolutionary rhetoric is humanities 2.0.
>"Humanities 2.0 is distinguished from monumental, first-generation, data-based projects not just by its interactivity but also by openness about participation grounded in a different set of theoretical premises, which decenter knowledge and authority" (Davidson 2008).

Much like the transition of the internet from web 1.0 to web 2.0, the transition from humanities 1.0 to humanities 2.0 is one in which the afforded capabilities of information technology are more fully utilized. Where humanities computing namely used information technology for its computational abilities, the digital humanities leverage both the computational and communicative power of information  technology.

[No one has explored the expressive potential of information technology for the the digital humanities than Tara McPherson and her team with the journal Vectors. The aim of the journal is to publish "that which cannot be printed." Each "article" is a lovingly hand-crafted work of art, the result of an intense collaboration between designers, coders, editors, and scholars. The works themselves are fully multi-modal, leveraging the full power of the web, to create textual, auditory, visual, and interactive experiences and experiments in rhetoric and narrative.](connect to dissemination discussion?)

With Vectors, McPherson created a platform for what she calls "multimodal humanities." In her account, the digital humanities has evolved in three stages: computing humanities, blogging humanities, and multimodal humanities.

In the computing humanities,
> "humanities scholars have been actively engaged in working with computer technology for over twenty years. Nonetheless, these “computing humanists” sometimes labored in relative isolation from the questions that animated research in other aspects of their home disciplines, particularly work derived from interpretative frameworks or from poststructuralist theories" (McPherson 2008)

This is the realm of Father Busa, William McCarty and humanities computing. This is what Davidson called Humanities 1.0. But, as McPherson notes, this stage of the digital humanities "labored in relative isolation." As I have noted before, this has been confirmed by Joula (2008); the work of "computing humanists" did not have significant impact, at least until networked computing emerged with the internet and perhaps more importantly, the web. Along with the sea changes in science, industry and culture, along with the web emerged a stage of the digital humanities, the "blogging humanities." 

> "More recently, we have seen an explosion of what I might call the “blogging humanists”—folks very interested in the hopes for participation promised by emerging Web 2.0 technologies. Faced with severe cut-backs at academic presses and dated systems for peer review, this second breed of digital humanists port the words and monographs of humanities scholarship to networked spaces of conversation and dialogue. They envision new modes of connection and peer-to-peer conversation, and text often remains the lingua franca of their scholarly productions." (McPherson 2008)

This is the realm of Dan Cohen, Cathy Davidson, HASTAC and Humanities 2.0. This characterization is what is most current when people think about the digital humanities (that is, if they aren't talking about humanities computing). This is a very inclusive space, where scholars both use digital methods and study digital objects. Unlike computing humanities, blogging humanities challenges taken-for-granted social institutions like peer-review, and it does so with both content and form. Examples include blogging, tweeting, and publishing experiments like Cathleen Fitzpatrick's [Planned Obsolescence](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/mcpress/plannedobsolescence/) or the Digital Humanities Now from the newly formed experimental [PressForward](http://pressforward.org. But, as McPherson points out, these productions are still primarily textual, at the end of the day they are still words on the screen. 
>"[W]e have been slow to explore the potential of interactive, immersive, and multimedia expression for our own thinking and scholarship, even as we dabble with such forms in our teaching. With a few exceptions, we remain content to comment about technology and media, rather than to participate more actively in constructing knowledge in and through our objects of study." (McPherson 2008)

As I mentioned above, with Vectors McPherson envisions a radically departure from textual content and forms. Digital information technology affords a media experience that we have only just begun to explore. 





## Enter "Big Tent" Digital Humanities

The most crisp and clear articulation of "what is the digital humanities" come from a blog post by William Pannacker. The post, which he wrote for the Chronicle of Higher Education recounts his experiences at the Digital Humanities conference at Stanford in June of 2011. 

He begins 
>"After generations of relatively quiet progress—going back to the era of punch cards—the digital humanities has exploded into academic consciousness as the Next Big Thing at a time when the humanities seem to be in big trouble." (Pannacker 2011a) 

But not without a taste of self-deprecating skepticism 
>" As one young postdoc complained to me, 'Lots of people are trying to hitch their wagon to the digital humanities star.' And maybe I am one of them." (2011a)

Pannapacker sees himself as neither an insider or an outsider to this emerging cohort of humanities scholars, he notes the conference is mostly graduate students and post-docs, and from this unique vantage point (perhaps implicitly as the "adult in the room?") he makes a very keen observation about the digital humanities, the "digital humanities is a comprehensive activist project that uses technology to respond to the interconnected cultural and structural problems of academe." He goes on, "It redefines the nature of academic careers while dealing with longstanding disciplinary conversations. And it engages in complex, theoretical heavy lifting while building projects that are often based on the Internet, available to the public, and indisputably useful...Like the founders and builders of museums, libraries, concert halls, and critical editions in the last century, digital humanists are creating the new infrastructure of our history and culture and changing the nature of education and scholarship." (Pannapacker 2011)

What I like about Pannapacker's articulation of the digital humanities is it directly acknowledges the revolutionary tendency of the digital humanities project. It is very much an "activist" movement and has been since the humanities computing days. Although what is distinct between then and now is the scope and explicitness of that revolutionary rhetoric. Pannapacker's account of what he saw and heard at DH 2011 was extremely inclusive, even including the new-in-name, but not new-in-practice, 'alt-ac' community. Alternative Academic careers are those PhDs who have "gone off the grid" (or 'downshifted' in british parlance) to work as technologists or librarians, and opted out of the tenure-track rat race. 

The alt-ac community is an important aspect of the digital humanities community, but one that is hard to place in a definition that focuses on either research methods or objects; it adds another layer of depth and complexity to my digital humanities quadrant. The recent HASTAC conference, another digital humanities gathering place, opened with an alt-ac workshop. During which several alternative academic professionals described their own experiences working as technologists, librarians, or publishers. 

Much of discussion and debate in the digital humanities is happening outside the traditional, peer-reviewed literature. What began as a hash tag on twitter has now become a rallying points for discussions about alternative paths for humanties PhDs. [(Nowviskie 2011)](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/pieces/introduction-two-tramps-mud-time) The discussion quickly outgrew twitter and evolved into an online edited volume at MediaCommons, the structure and form of which is a living embodiment of what I believe to be the essence of the digital humanities:
>["#alt-academy is both an edited collection and the embodiment of a grassroots, publish-then-filter approach to networked scholarly communication. All community members can comment on existing essays and freely publish relevant work as part of this site, thereby making their content available at a stable URL and discoverable through search. However, only selected contributions will be featured on the #alt-ac home page as part of our edited "clusters."](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/how-it-works)

The alt-academy site at media commons represents the most lofty ideals of the digital humanities. It is open-access, post-publish-peer-reviewed, contributions are measures by their merit, not who wrote them (at least at face value). The cast of contributers includes senior & junior scholars, post-docs, librarians, administrators, developers, and even at least graduate student (although he identified himself as a designer). 

Matt Kirschenbaum has also notices a trend to include an expanded notion of legitimate participant in the digital humanities. Th
>"Digital humanities has also, I would propose, lately been galvanized by a group of younger (or not so young) graduate students, faculty members (both tenure line and contingent), and other academic professionals who now wield the label “digital humanities” instrumentally amid an increasingly monstrous institutional terrain defined by declining public support for higher education, rising tuitions, shrinking endowments, the proliferation of distance education and the for- profit university, and, underlying it all, the conversion of full- time, tenure- track academic labor to a part- time adjunct workforce." (2010)

The crisis in the humanities, alt-ac, and the digital humanities are complexly intermingled. The boundaries between these various phenomena are extremely pourous. Analytically, I think it is most useful to think about them as an ecosystem that has recently been disrupted by various crises as noted by Kirschenbaum. Admist these crises digital humanities emerges as a new habitat within which we can find new niches, like alt-ac. Crucial however is a need for us as scholars, students, and related professionals to adapt to the changing socio-technical environment. As we struggle to return to homeostasis, a point of dynamic stability within the complex ecosystem, the external selection pressures of the various crises are going to force us to change. Those who don't evolve? They become baristas? Perhaps this is too much of a fatalistic analogy, but for those of us graduating now and in the next few years, the anxious uncertainty around our futures can easily lead to effusive pessimism.

So what then is "digital humanities?" It is an immuno response by the academic organism of the humanities, to a host of crises, some of which are directly or indirectly connected to broader technological change. We can think about the digital humanities as a multi-method, multi-modal, interdisciplinary domain focused on studying digital culture in the broadest of terms. Inside of this domain lives specific methodological thrusts, like humanities computing or common sets of research interests like new media studies.


## The Humanist Quadrant

It is perhaps reductionist and categorical, but in light of the current chaos of the disciplines, a quadrant juxtaposing digital methods vs. digital objects is useful as a map.

<img src="../humanist-quadrant.png" width="570" height="517"/>

The delegation of the so called "traditional humanities" to the lower left square of the quadrant is by no means a minimization of salience. Nor am I seriously implying there is no relation between the traditional humanities and the rest of the square. But this quadrant needs to be here, as an other, because the discussions about humanities computing and the digital humanities often define themselves in relation to a mythical "traditional humanities." Somewhere, a humanist still scours paper archives, jotting down notes on their yellow pad to write up on their typewriter in the form of a 300 page monograph to be mailed to a university press. Obviously, digital methods and objects have leaked into even the most traditional of humanities scholar's practice, but the point remains, humanities computing and the digital humanities see themselves as something distinct and new from the traditional humanities. 

Computational linguistics, computer assisted textual analysis, spatial history, modeling, without computation would be logistically or practically impossible; they are digitally native in the methodological sense. Digitally native methods are those historically associated with humanities computing. Father Busa's Index Thomisticus or Willard McCarty's work "Finding Implicit Patterns in Ovid's Metamorphoses with TACT" (McCarty 1996) would both fit squarely in the upper left quadrant. Now the objects used by humanities computing are obviously digital, but they are also indexical to an analog form. They are models or representations (which one could argue are digitally native) of existing (usually textual) research objects (Unsworth 2002). 

The bottom right of the quadrant, the use of traditional methods to study digitally native objects, is as I have shown, a newcomer to the big tent. The arrival of this quadrent from domains like new media studies, critical theory and TK was met with some consternation from the humanities computing folks who, with the name change in the oxford companion, had tried to claim the territory for themselves (Svensson 2009).  This community has an uneasy relationship with the monkier "digital humanities." Note a recent faculty search and cluster hire at the University of Michigan was dubbed "digital environments" instead of "digital humanities." Furthermore, those hired study digitally native objects (Spam, Algorithms, Flash media, networks) but do not necessarily deploy digitally native methodologies.  At the same time, communities like HASTAC have very boldly staked their claim, the study of digitally native objects, regardless of methodology, belongs in the big tent digital humanities. 

This leaves the final quadrant in my diagram, the folks who study digitally native objects using digitally native methods. This, curiously, seems to me to be the smallest of the four quadrants. This kind of research, natural language processing of blogs, or spatial analysis of tweets, is common in the social sciences, but this style of work in the humanities is, at least from my perspective, quite uncommon. I suspect, if I were to survey the digital humanities graduate student population I might find more examples of this work, but in the digital humanities today I see very little of it. Where are the computer assisted textual analyses of blogs, or the spatial history of tweets? The interpretivist social sciences are going to be the place to find this work. 

One glaring omission from this quadrant is the social infrastructure of alt-ac. The humanist quadrant privileges traditional notions of scholarly "work" at the expense of others. We need to explore another dimension of this analytical diagram, one that plunges into the depths of the "invisible work" (Star & Strauss) by administrators, librarians, temporary researchers, and graduate students. This invisible work, which has been so exhaustively studied in the sciences (Burton & Jackson 2012, Star & Ruhleder 1996, Shapin 1988, Collins ???), has yet to be conducted in the humanities and digital humanities. If, as the rhetoric of the "big tent" will lead us to believe, the digital humanities is inclusive then we must find how how much "work" is truly made visible. In the spirit of Bowker's "Memory Practices of the Sciences" (2006) we need a "Memory Practices of the Humanities."
