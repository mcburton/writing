<h1>Pedagogy</h1>

The tensions associated with the changes in the humanities are particularly visible in the structures of social reproducibility. If we are to worry about distortion of the humanities, then more attention should be spent considering what kinds of training, in terms of method, theory and practice, the next generation of (digital) humanists receives.

The debate amongst digital humanists about learning to program is fascinating. While I do not intend to do full justice to the debate, I will explore some recent discussion below. I am including this discussion because it raises some interesting questions about how the humanities is changing/distorting as a field and also the debate implicitly asks "what is being lost." Throughout the humanities infrastructure discussion are calls to include humanists because of the specific insights they can bring to the design of technology and infrastructure. I,  call this the 'humanist mystique' 

The full extent to which pedagogy is affected by the digital humanities covers a much larger spectrum than just the code debate and the humanist mystique. I am making no claims as to completeness. I include these two topics because of their relation to humanities infrastructure and, as I'll explore in the section on scholarship and dissemination, grey literature.
