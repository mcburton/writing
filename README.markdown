## What is this?
Some folks might end up here who don't already know what this is. This is my field prelim, it is an extensive literature review of a topic (or set of topics) and a proposal for a research project. I am a graduate student at the [School of Information at the University of Michigan](https://si.umich.edu). 

This github repository will be used for sharing, collaboration and tracking my progress. 

### Repository Contents
*  *toc.markdown* - This is a table of contents and general outline for my prelim.
*  *introduction.markdown* - This is the current draft of the introduction.
*  *annotatedbib.markdown* - This is an annotated bibliography 
*  *squaring-research-design.markdown* - This is some unstructured free writing about the project and some thinking about the research design.
