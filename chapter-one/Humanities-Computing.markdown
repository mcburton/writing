The current momentum of the digital humanities is rooted in the slow, methodological plodding of humanities computing for the past 60 years.</a>

In an MLA report, Cathy Davidson dubbed the first revolution in computational technology in the humanities as Humanities 1.0. Drawing upon Tim O'Reily's Web 1.0 / 2.0 distinction, Davidson argues humanities computing, which like web 1.0, was the first shift instigated by technology in the humanities. This shift, Davidson claims–and I am inclined to agree–focused on new research practice in the humanities. 

>"Humanities 1.0— computational humanities—has changed the way we do research, the kinds of questions we can ask, and the depth, breadth, and detail of the answers we can provide to those questions" (Davidson 2008)
There is no question that humanities computing has been revolutionary, although in comparison with recent events it almost appears conservative. Such a criticism doesn't properly situate humanities computing historically. Humanities computing has been slowly and methodologically chipping away at the foundations of humanist research practice. Their work, exploring the use of computation in humanist inquiry, has cleared the way for the digital humanities.

The discursive shift from humanities computing to digital humanities has been a significant moment in the evolution of the field (Svensson 2009, Unsworth 2004). In less than a decade, the digital humanities, not humanities computing, has risen to prominence as a significant movement within the humanities. Tensions and contests emerge when attempts are made to define the digital humanities as simply a re-branded humanities computing. This tension arises from digital humanities coming to represent a much larger domain of practice than tools and methods. I will address full scope of the "big tent" of the digital humanities later, but for now I suggest it is useful to think of digital humanities as an amorphous super-set of a tightly defined humanities computing. There is little contention that work on tools and methods in humanities research is the domain of humanities computing.

Humanities computing, both the term and the practice, have been with the humanities for a very long time. Yet, humanities computing scholarship has, by external measures, had dramatic impact upon the humanities community [(Joula 2008)](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/73.abstract). Joula attributes this to both a lack of incentive by traditional humanists, but also an inability to understand the work. For scholars versed in the methods of the traditional humanities, say for example close reading, the notion of statistical analysis of texts is not only foreign but glosses aspects of the text they deem most important.

On the impact of humanities computing, Willard McCarty had these fine words to say on the humanist mailing list,

>"We're always worrying ourselves about whether humanities computing has made its mark in the world and on the world. It seems to me, however, that quiet change, though harder to detect, is sometimes much better and more powerful in its effects than the noisy, obviously mark-making, position-taking kind. If during these 17 years Humanist has contributed to the world, it has done so very quietly by nature, like conversation, leaving hardly a trace." [(Humanist 18.001)](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/humanist/Archives/Virginia/v18/0000.html)
I love this passage, perhaps because of my personal predilection for quiet change. This notion of detection is tricky, if change is not visible, detectable, or measurable, is it change at all? Intuitively, humanities computing has certainly had an impact, it laid the groundwork for the current enthusiasm in the digital humanities. Unfortunately, foundation building is a somewhat thankless task and credit is not always given where credit is due.

<!-- The humanities, which is celebrated by some as open to all methods and ideologies, should embrace, but also critically situate these "harder" methods and tools. Recent efforts like the [Praxis Program at the UVA Scholars Lab](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/) or books like the Oxford Companion to the Digital Humanities have begun to help alleviate the alien-ness of these methods. As I will explore further, the questions of skills is a hotly debated topic, in part due to the porous boundary between humanities computing and the digital humanities. Specifically, the question of "should digital humanists know how to code" is a focal point of tension between the digital humanities and humanities computing. -->
