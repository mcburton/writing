# Bring in the Clowns: Big Tent Digital Humanities
	
	
"Let me expand on what I mean by “digital humanities.” We use “digital humanities” as an umbrella term for a number of different activities that surround technology and humanities scholarship. Under the digital humanities rubric, I would include topics like open access to materials, intellectual property rights, tool development, digital libraries, data mining, born-digital preservation, multimedia publication, visualization, GIS, digital reconstruction, study of the impact of technology on numerous fields, technology for teaching and learning, sustainability models, and many others." (Bobley 2008 [http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/odhfiles/Why.The.Digital.Humanities.pdf])


Brett Bobley on Digital Humanities vs humanities computing - "seemed to cast a wider net than “humanities computing” which seemed to imply a form of computing, whereas “digital humanities” implied a form of humanism. I also thought it would be an easier sell to the humanities community to have the emphasis on “humanities.”(from Kirschenbaum 2010) It is important that a funding agency has taken a big tent approach to digital humanities rather than either adopt the name humanities computing (and its epistemological commitments) or a computationally focused approach to the digital humanities.




In the first two of his four part series on the digital humanities, Patrick Svensson explores the relation between the humanities and information technology. The articles provide both a deep and broad analysis of the field as a whole, exploring its historical roots in humanities compuing, the discursive shift towards digital humanities, and the ongoing expansion into a multimodel second-wave of "humanities 2.0." 

Svensson notes the "digital humanities comprise a field in a loose sense...an inclusive notion that will allow us to talk about different kinds of initiatives and activities in the intersection between the humanities and information technology or the digital." (Svensson 2009) This is an important observation, for it highlights the digital humanities is more a _conversation_ and a common social object enabling solidarity in a sea of quiddity.
>"at its core, then, digital humanities is more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even technologies....Yet digital humanities is also a social undertaking. It harbors networks of people who have been working together, sharing research, arguing, competing, and collaborating for many years. "(Kirschenbaum 2010)

To claim the digital humanities is merely method cuts off and isolates the social "work" emerging from the the socio-technical edge of the humanities. It ignores the legitimate peripheral participation (cite) of workers and work that has historically been at the margins of the academy (it is also perhaps doubly ironic because humanities computing had been marginalized as well). Digital humanities, as I'll discuss below, has become much more inclusive to participation from those who would not normally be considered traditional academics, both in their practice (multimodal scholars) and in their institutional home (alternative academics).






## Enter "Big Tent" Digital Humanities

The most crisp and clear articulation of "what is the digital humanities" come from a blog post by William Pannacker. The post, which he wrote for the Chronicle of Higher Education, recounts his experiences at the Digital Humanities conference at Stanford in June of 2011. What I particularly love about his definition is the clear (as an aside, [I asked him if he was writing up his experience at HASTAC and he responded, yes.](https://twitter.com/#!/mcburton/status/148415580066689024))

He begins 
>"After generations of relatively quiet progress—going back to the era of punch cards—the digital humanities has exploded into academic consciousness as the Next Big Thing at a time when the humanities seem to be in big trouble." (Pannacker 2011a) 

But not without a taste of self-deprecating skepticism 
>" As one young postdoc complained to me, 'Lots of people are trying to hitch their wagon to the digital humanities star.' And maybe I am one of them." (2011a)

Pannapacker sees himself as neither an insider or an outsider to this emerging cohort of humanities scholars, he notes the conference is mostly graduate students and post-docs, and from this unique vantage point (perhaps implicitly as the "adult in the room?") he makes a very keen observation about the digital humanities, the "digital humanities is a comprehensive activist project that uses technology to respond to the interconnected cultural and structural problems of academe." He goes on, "It redefines the nature of academic careers while dealing with longstanding disciplinary conversations. And it engages in complex, theoretical heavy lifting while building projects that are often based on the Internet, available to the public, and indisputably useful...Like the founders and builders of museums, libraries, concert halls, and critical editions in the last century, digital humanists are creating the new infrastructure of our history and culture and changing the nature of education and scholarship." (Pannapacker 2011)

What I like about Pannapacker's articulation of the digital humanities is it directly acknowledges the revolutionary tendency of the digital humanities project. It is very much an "activist" movement and has been since the humanities computing days. Although what is distinct between then and now is the scope and explicitness of that revolutionary rhetoric. Pannapacker's account of what he saw and heard at DH 2011 was extremely inclusive, even including the new-in-name, but not new-in-practice, 'alt-ac' community. Alternative Academic careers are those PhDs who have "gone off the grid" (or 'downshifted' in british parlance) to work as technologists or librarians, and opted out of the tenure-track rat race. 

The alt-ac community is an important aspect of the digital humanities community, but one that is hard to place in a definition that focuses on either research methods or objects; it adds another layer of depth and complexity to my digital humanities quadrant. The recent HASTAC conference, another digital humanities gathering place, opened with an alt-ac workshop. During which several alternative academic professionals described their own experiences working as technologists, librarians, or publishers. 

Much of discussion and debate in the digital humanities is happening outside the traditional, peer-reviewed literature. What began as a hash tag on twitter has now become a rallying points for discussions about alternative paths for humanties PhDs. [(Nowviskie 2011)](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/pieces/introduction-two-tramps-mud-time) The discussion quickly outgrew twitter and evolved into an online edited volume at MediaCommons, the structure and form of which is a living embodiment of what I believe to be the essence of the digital humanities:
>["#alt-academy is both an edited collection and the embodiment of a grassroots, publish-then-filter approach to networked scholarly communication. All community members can comment on existing essays and freely publish relevant work as part of this site, thereby making their content available at a stable URL and discoverable through search. However, only selected contributions will be featured on the #alt-ac home page as part of our edited "clusters."](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/how-it-works)

The alt-academy site at media commons represents the most lofty ideals of the digital humanities. It is open-access, post-publish-peer-reviewed, contributions are measures by their merit, not who wrote them (at least at face value). The cast of contributers includes senior & junior scholars, post-docs, librarians, administrators, developers, and even at least graduate student (although he identified himself as a designer). 

Matt Kirschenbaum has also notices a trend to include an expanded notion of legitimate participant in the digital humanities. Th
>"Digital humanities has also, I would propose, lately been galvanized by a group of younger (or not so young) graduate students, faculty members (both tenure line and contingent), and other academic professionals who now wield the label “digital humanities” instrumentally amid an increasingly monstrous institutional terrain defined by declining public support for higher education, rising tuitions, shrinking endowments, the proliferation of distance education and the for- profit university, and, underlying it all, the conversion of full- time, tenure- track academic labor to a part- time adjunct workforce." (2010)

The crisis in the humanities, alt-ac, and the digital humanities are complexly intermingled. The boundaries between these various phenomena are extremely pourous. Analytically, I think it is most useful to think about them as an ecosystem that has recently been disrupted by various crises as noted by Kirschenbaum. Admist these crises digital humanities emerges as a new habitat within which we can find new niches, like alt-ac. Crucial however is a need for us as scholars, students, and related professionals to adapt to the changing socio-technical environment. As we struggle to return to homeostasis, a point of dynamic stability within the complex ecosystem, the external selection pressures of the various crises are going to force us to change. Those who don't evolve? They become baristas? Perhaps this is too much of a fatalistic analogy, but for those of us graduating now and in the next few years, the anxious uncertainty around our futures can easily lead to effusive pessimism.

So what then is "digital humanities?" It is an immuno response by the academic organism of the humanities, to a host of crises, some of which are directly or indirectly connected to broader technological change. We can think about the digital humanities as a multi-method, multi-modal, interdisciplinary domain focused on studying digital culture in the broadest of terms. Inside of this domain lives specific methodological thrusts, like humanities computing or common sets of research interests like new media studies.
