# Chapter 4 - Research Design / Design Research

## Intro

[This draft of the research design is drawing on concepts straight out of ethnomethodology, especially ethnomethodological "accounts." The previous chapters, once written, will hopefully situate and develop those concepts within the digital humanities and scholarly publishing. Ackerman's aphorism is not yet fully developed and is being used right now as a conceptual bridge between the motivations described in the introduction and the research proposed here.

this prose is severely un-edited.]

The theoretical and conceptual interest of this research is "Ackerman's Aphorism." I'll explore the disparity between technological possibility and social acceptability. Like the disparity between social fluidity and technological rigidity, I believe the gap between technology and social practice, or between techno-practice and accounts, provides a fruitful site for informing a broader understanding of human machine interaction. Humanists face, perhaps now more than ever, the tensions of Ackerman's aphorism. As science studies has shown, designing and building (cyber)infrastructure is not simply a matter of "build it an they will come." As humanists embrace scholarship in the digital age, a change embodied in the digital humanities, they will wrestle with many of the similar problems that have been studied in workplaces or in science space. However, epistemological differences in the humanist community of practice may reveal unique features of their work-practice as they "technologize." 

Deeply situated, social scientific investigations bring a fresh set of eyes to the practical challenges of changing the interaction between scholars, publishers, and technology. The challenge for empirically oriented research is to find where the dynamics of Ackerman's aphorism manifest socio-materially, that is, to find where the rubber hits the road to see how sociality governs and shapes technological adoption. For this project, I have identified two locations, one at the intersection between scholars and publishers, negotiating publishing strategies at a university press, and another in the development of information standards for electronic publishing.

## Social Studies of the Digital Humanities

I take seriously Christine Borgman's challenge: "Where are the social studies of digital humanities? (2009)" For reasons beyond the scope of this discussion, social studies have focused most of their attention upon the sciences. Borgman believes, as I do, that there are significant opportunities to not only inform the digital humanities, but to inform the social studies of science. Humanist scholar's work-practices have not been explored to the same degree as those of the physicists, astronomer, or medical doctor. This needs to change. With emergence of the digital humanities we can no longer afford to ignore the other half of the academy. 

[TODO:As julie klein points out, I can put McCarty in a harmonious dialog with Borgman.]

The digital humanities has given rise to a reflexive dialog, often to the point of naval gazing, about humanities scholarship in the digital age. Social scientists need to be privy to these conversations. The timing could not be better, as digital humanists engage in collective sensemaking, they welcome members of other domains. Currently missing from the digital humanist's discourse is the voice of social scientists who have already observed technology's destabilizing changes to the sciences. Furthermore, there is a distinct gap in the science studies literature about the emergence of the digital humanities (though this begs the question, would these investigations count as science studies?). With this study I answer Borgman's challenge with a simple "Here."

## Humanist Knowledge in and through Practice

[This section will draw on the theoretical scaffolding laid in earlier chapters. Currently this is drawing from EM investigations of scientific practice, I wonder if I can swap out the work-practice with scientific practice? What is here right now is a summary of some arguments I _hope_ to make.]

Ethnomethodological studies of scientific practice (Garfinkel, Lynch, & Livingston 198?, Lynch 199?, Burton & Jackson 2012, etc) are keen to argue that the act of "doing science" is fundamentally social action of producing ethnomethodological _accounts_. These accounts are often embodied in artifacts like datasets, charts, graphs, peer-reviewed journal articles and the occasional book. The locally situated lived experience of science, as part of the ever ongoing _and changing_ "immortal ordinary society" (Garfinkel ????), has by virtue of being science, the exceptional challenge of producing valid and acceptable accounts. Unlike the practices of everyday life, scientists must account for their practice under very specific _contexts of accountability_. If you cannot orient your work and produce an account that fits into the scientific contexts of accountability, you are by definition, not doing science.

As has been demonstrated, much of work-practice in science and workplace settings, is oriented around the successful production of meaningful accounts. There is always a gap between the expectations of the context of accountability and the everyday lived experience of work. This is the gap between the formal and the informal, the explicit and the implicit, between plans and situated action (Suchman 200?). Many social studies focus on accounts as if they were actual reflections what what actors actually did, but this neglects the whole host of practical and ordinary action of actors producing those accounts.


## Research Settings

I propose an ethnomethodologically oriented investigation of two different, but related, sites related. The first observes (and participates) in the interactions between scholars and publishers at a university press as they work towards a common understanding of how to best disseminate the scholar's academic work. This is the active and ongoing work of orienting the scholars previous work in the production of an ethnomethodological account.

I have an emerging relationship with MPublishing, the University of Michigan's office of publishing. Mpublishing's services span an ever broadening horizon, from monograph production and printing books, to electronic journals, to archiving digital artifacts and producing multi-modal scholarly information systems. It is the boundary pushing work, their experiments in new modalities of publishing, such as putting books online via CommentPress or websites like [Theater Historiography](http://theater-historiography.org/), that holds my interest. As I see it, Mpublishing is actively experimenting and testing the boundaries of acceptable publishing practice, exploring the gap of Ackerman's Aphorism, or the “divide between what we know is possible technically and what is acceptable socially.”

The second site is of a more technical nature. Starting with a trace ethnography (Giger & Ribes 200?), I'll analyze the International Digital Publishing Forum's (IDPF) working group's conversations as they developed the EPUB 3 digital publishing standard. The EPUB 3 document format is a collective effort by multiple stakeholders; publishers, technologists, hardware developers, and many others. The trace ethnography, combined with interviews with working group members, provides the context for a technomethodological investigation of practitioner's adoption or non adoption of the EPUB 3 standard.


## Scholars & Publisher's Production of Accounts

Where to begin? This research complements the EPUB 3 work in that it focuses on practitioner's actual work exploring the newly afforded activities of  My desire is to attend very specifically upon what scholars and publishers _do_. Monograph publishing practice in the digital humanities has two facets; facets that are informative both epistemologically and practically. First, there is the facet of ordinary work. This is the ever-present "goings on" 

Second, there is the production of accounts. In my proposed work sites, the scholarly publishing office and the epub3 working group, members of these groups must _account_ for their ordinary work, this is the work of producing artifacts that satisfy pre-existing expectations of a particular context of accountability. What does this mean? Allow me to use an example described by Burgress and Hamming. In their article "New Media in the Academy: Labor and the Production of Knowledge in Scholarly Multimedia." they described how multimedia scholarship toes a fine line between art and scholarship. Using the example of Marcel O'Gorman's _Dreadmill_, which consists of a live on-stage performance by O'Gorman running on a treadmill whilst presenting a critique of our culture's increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Burgess and Hamming ask the question "How might such a performance be classified as a work of scholarship?" Burgess and Hamming answer "[i]n a supreme irony, it is only have the project [performance] has itself become the object of critical inquiry, for instance in a scholarly print article reflecting on the visual rhetorics of multimedia design, do these activities come into view. (Burgess & Hamming 2011)"

What we are seeing, from an ethnomethodological perspective, is an "ordinary" activity, the locally situated performance, followed by the work of producing a suitable account of that activity. An account, the print articles reflecting _about_ the performance, satisfy existing expectations of the scholarly publishing. The reflexive activity of "making visible" the performance to a broader scholarly community, that is, making it cite-able, making it quote-able, making it count-able, is the location of interesting and understudied innovation This site is where the rubber hits the road for Ackerman's aphorism, it a uniquely creative kind of work where scholars and publisher's collaborate to fit square peg into round holes.

The gap between the ordinary work of digital humanist scholars and the accounts they produce of that work is a rich space filled with innovations. Scholars whose work falls well outside the contexts of accountability, that is they don't fit within the traditional publishing models, must come up with creative ways to make their work count. I wish to show how these innovations push and prod the boundaries of traditional publishing, a modest, but relentless selection pressure aggregating from the work individual scholars and publishers to force traditional publishing to adapt.

## EPUB3 - Designing Publishing Infrastructure

Standards development and standard adoption is an excellent site to observe where the "rubber hits the road" for Ackerman's aphorism. The interactions across multiple communities of practice as they come to a common understanding reveal much about the assumptions and expectations of those communities (Rawls, Garcia, David, Mann, Burton 200?). We can unpack these dynamics using a technomethodologicial approach as advocated by Andy Crabtree:
"
	1. Let designers build whatever they want with whomever they want, subject to their own constraints.
	2. Deploy the objects of design in real world settings.
	3. Treat deployment as a breaching experiment. [TODO: describe breaching experiment]
	4. Explicate the accountable structures of practical action made visible in the breach.
	5. Explore the topics identified in the breach through the study of perspicuous settings. [TODO: describe perspicuous settings]
	6. Use the studies of perspicuous settings to flesh out abstract design concepts.
	7. Deploy the new design solution in real world settings and study its use.
	8. Repeat the process until the research agenda has been satisfied for all practical purposes."
" (Crabtree 2004)

As of this writing, the EPUB 3 document format is nearly complete. The designers of the standards have "built whatever they want," rather quickly for standards designers I might add, and we will shortly witness the deployment of EPUB 3 into "real world settings." The latest epub standard is a radical technological advancement to its predecessor, as such it is an _experiment_ that _breaches_ our commonly held expectations of the book. EPUB 3 incorporates the latest web technologies enabling interactive, multimedia enriched presentations. How this technology, the the possibilities for knowledge dissemination it enables, is an open question.
