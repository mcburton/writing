# Chapter 4 - Research Design / Design Research

## Intro

The theoretical and conceptual interest of this research is "Ackerman's Aphorism." My interest is in the disparity between technological possibility and social acceptability. Like the disparity between social fluidity and technological rigidity, I believe the gaps opened up by these phenomena provide a fruitful site for informing a broader understanding of human machine interaction. Humanists face, perhaps now more than ever, the tensions of Ackerman's aphorism. As science studies has shown, designing and building (cyber)infrastructure is not simply a matter of "build it an they will come." As humanists embrace scholarship in the digital age, a change embodied by the digital humanities movement, they will wrestle with many of the similar problems as scientists doing the same. However, epistemological differences in the humanist community of practice may also cause significant differences as they "technologize." 

Deeply situated, social scientific investigations bring a fresh set of eyes to the practical challenges of change, be it change in scientific or humanist practice,  in the interactions between scholars, publishers, and technology. The challenge for empirically oriented research is to find where the dynamics of Ackerman's aphorism manifest socio-materially, that is, to find where the rubber hits the road. For this project, I have identified two locations, one at the intersection between scholars and publishers, negotiating publishing strategies at a university press, and another in the interactional traces of the  information standards developers for electronic publishing.

## Social Studies of the Digital Humanities

I take seriously Christine Borgman's challenge: "Where are the social studies of digital humanities? (2009)" For reasons beyond the scope of this discussion, social studies have focused most of their attention upon the sciences. Borgman believes, as I do, that there are significant opportunities to not only inform the digital humanities, but to inform the social studies of science. Humanist scholar's work-practices have not been explored to the same degree as those of the physicists, astronomer, or medical doctor. This needs to change. With emergence of the digital humanities we can no longer afford to ignore the other half of the academy. 

The digital humanities has given rise to a reflexive dialog, often to the point of naval gazing, about humanities scholarship in the digital age. Social scientists need to be privy to these conversations. The timing could not be better, as digital humanists engage in a collective self-sensemaking, they welcome members of other domains. Currently missing from the digital humanist's discourse is the voice of social scientists who have already observed technology's destabilizing changes to the sciences. Furthermore, there is a distinct gap in the science studies literature about the emergence of the digital humanities (though this begs the question, would these investigations count as science studies?). With this study I answer Borgman's challenge with a simple "Here."

## Humanist Knowledge in and through Practice

[This section will draw on the theoretical scaffolding laid in earlier chapters. What is here right now is a summary of some arguments I _hope_ to write.]

Ethnomethodological studies of scientific practice (Garfinkel, Lynch, & Livingston 198?, Lynch 199?, Burton & Jackson 2012, etc) are keen to argue that the act of "doing science" is fundamentally social action of producing ethnomethodological accounts. These accounts are often embodied in artifacts like datasets, charts, graphs, peer-reviewed journal articles and the occasional book. The locally situated lived experience of science, as part of the ever ongoing _and changing_ "immortal ordinary society" (Garfinkel ????), has by virtue of being science, the exceptional challenge of producing valid and acceptable accounts. Unlike the practices of everyday life, scientists must account for their practice under very specific _contexts of accountability_. If you cannot orient your work and produce an account that fits into the scientific contexts of accountability, you are by definition, not doing science.

As has been demonstrated, much of work-practice in science and workplace settings, is oriented around the successful production of meaningful accounts. There is always a gap between the expectations of the context of accountability and the everyday lived experience of work. This is the gap between the formal and the informal, the explicit and the implicit, between plans and situated action (Suchman 200?).

Scholarly publishing is the production of Ethnomethodological accounts. It is the work of scholars, certainly of scientists and we presume humanists as well, to formulate what they have _done_ in an accountable form. This way of thinking means the practices of knowledge production in are intimately intertwined with those of scholarly publishing. 

 If we take seriously Crabtree's (2004) assertion that "the real world of things concrete only exists for human beings as a result of human practice, and as practice changes so does our understanding of the real world of things concrete." Then we consider seriously the fact that the digital humanities, as a change in humanist scholarly practice, may fundamentally threaten humanist knowledge. 

## Research Settings

I propose an ethnomethodologically oriented investigation of two radically different but related sites. The first observes (and participates) in the interactions between scholars and publishers at a university press as they work towards a common understanding of how to best disseminate the scholar's academic work. This is the active and ongoing work of orienting the scholars previous work in the production of an ethnomethodological account.

I have an emerging relationship with MPublishing, the University of Michgan's office of publishing. Mpublishing's services span an ever broadening horizon, from monograph production and printing books, to electronic journals, to archiving digital artifacts and producing multi-modal scholarly information systems. It is the boundary pushing work, their experiments in new modalities of publishing, such as putting books online via CommentPress or websites like [Theater Historiography](http://theater-historiography.org/), that holds my interest. As I see it, Mpublishing is actively experimenting and testing the boundaries of acceptable publishing practice, exploring the gap of Ackerman's Aphorism, or the “divide between what we know is possible technically and what is acceptable socially.”

I have a research site, MPublishing, and a conceptual and methodological orientation, work-practice and organizational routine, scoped down to a bite sized domain, publishing in the digital humanities. This research would both observer and work with MPublishing and the scholars they serve to  I have a research problem orbiting around Ackerman's Aphorism, wondering about scholarly publishing in the digital humanities. To frame my question using an evolutionary metaphor: The "crisis of scholarly publishing" pressures scholars and publishers to adapt, we talk talk about these changes conceptually and envision utopian techno-humanists, but how do these changes occur _in practice_? How do the habits, routines, and ordinary practical action of scholars and publishers adapt to these assumed "selection pressures?"

The second site is of a more historical nature. Using trace ethnographic techniques (Giger & Ribes 200?), I'll analyze an International Digital Publishing Forum's (IDPF) working group's conversations they developed the latest digital publishing standard, EPUB 3. These conversations are relevant because the represent an effort to advance the state of the art in publishing technology by setting a new baseline for electronic "Reading Systems. The epub3 document format is a collective effort by multiple stakeholders; publishers, technologists, hardware developers, and many others. Standards development is an excellent site to observe where the "rubber hits the road" for Ackerman's aphorism. The interactions across multiple communities of practice as they come to a common understanding reveal much about the assumptions and expectations of those communities (Rawls, Garcia, David, Mann, Burton 200?). 

Email discussions, meeting notes, wiki discussions, and the document revision repository are all publicly available. These resources, combined with interviews with working group members, digital humanists and publishers beginning to use epub3, and experiments producing epub3 documents myself all provide insight into how individual's adapt (or don't adapt) their work practice to accommodate new technology.


## Design Research as Methodology

Where to begin? I attend to what scholars and publishers _do_. For whatever it is, they do it for others and in that visibility, we can _see_ it.

I also toss into the mix a builder's mentality; baggage indubitably accompanying any "recovering" technologist. Once upon a time I was a programmer and computer scientist. Interesting circumstance first led me to the digital humanities as a part time programmer for the Zotero project. The desire to build tools and infrastructure to support scholarship, especially publishing, motivates my current research. One of the things that attracts me to the digital humanities is the "builder's enthusiasm,"[*](http://lenz.unl.edu/papers/2011/01/08/whos-in-and-whos-out.html) although this enthusiasm is accompanied by a dose of trepidation within the community. [*](http://www.samplereality.com/2011/05/25/the-digital-humanities-is-not-about-building-its-about-sharing/)

Building and designing sociotechnical infrastructure for DH is a key theme for this research design. My interest is not merely in "observing" the work practices of scholars and publishers, rather I believe to fully understand the "crisis of scholarly publishing" and the digital humanities, I need to _work with_ those who _do_. In ethnomethodological terms, I must obtain what is called _unique adequacy_ in , or an actor's understanding of the phenomena of interest. 

From Crabtree (2004), the technomethodologicial approach to design research:
	1. Let designers build whatever they want with whomever they want, subject to their own constraints.
	2. Deploy the objects of design in real world settings.
	3. Treat deployment as a breaching experiment.
	4. Explicate the accountable structures of practical action made visible in the breach.
	5. Explore the topics identified in the breach through the study of perspicuous settings.
	6. Use the studies of perspicuous settings to flesh out abstract design concepts.
	7. Deploy the new design solution in real world settings and study its use.
	8. Repeat the process until the research agenda has been satisfied for all practical purposes."
