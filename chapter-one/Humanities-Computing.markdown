In an MLA report, Cathy Davidson situated the revolution in computational technology in the humanities as Humanities 1.0. Drawing upon Tim O'Reily's Web 1.0 / 2.0 distinction, Davidson argues humanities computing, which like web 1.0, was a first generational shift in the humanities instigated by technological change. This shift, Davidson claims–and I am inclined to agree–resulted in new research practice in the humanities. 
	>"Humanities 1.0— computational humanities—has changed the way we do research, the kinds of questions we can ask, and the depth, breadth, and detail of the answers we can provide to those questions" (Davidson 2008)
When drawn with respect to humanities computing, the scope of research practice does not appear to be a contested boundary. All agree that tools and methods in humanities research is squarely the domain of humanities computing. 

The discursive shift from humanities computing to digital humanities has been a significant moment in the evolution of the field (Svensson 2009, Unsworth 200?). In less than a decade, the digital humanities, not humanities computing, has risen to prominence as a significant cultural shift within the humanities. Tensions and contests emerge when attempts are made to define the digital humanities as simply a re-branded humanities computing. This tension arises from digital humanities coming to represent a much larger domain of practice than tools and methods. I will address full scope of the "big tent" of the digital humanities later, but for now I suggest it is useful to think of digital humanities as an amorphous super-set of a tightly defined humanities computing.

Humanities computing, both the term and the practice, have been with the humanities for a very long time. Yet, humanities computing scholarship has, by external measures, had dramatic impact upon the humanities community (Joula 2008). Joula attributes this to both a lack of incentive by traditional humanists, but also an inability to understand the work. For scholars versed in the methods of the traditional humanities, say for example close reading, the notion of statistical analysis of texts is not only foreign but glosses aspects of the text they deem most important. 

The humanities, which is celebrated by some as open to all methods and ideologies, should embrace, but also critically situate these "harder" methods and tools. Recent efforts like the [Praxis Program at the UVA Scholars Lab](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/) or books like the Oxford Companion to the Digital Humanities have begun to help alleviate the alien-ness of these methods. As I will explore further below, the questions of skills is a hotly debated topic, in part due to the porous boundary between humanities computing and the digital humanities. Specifically, the question of "should digital humanists know how to code" is a focal point of tension between the digital humanities and humanities computing.
