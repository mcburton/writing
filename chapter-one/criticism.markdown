	"humanists have access to technology but are in search of questions: What scholarship becomes possible when, from their desktops, scholars can access vast stores of admittedly highly het-erogeneous data together with powerful capabilities for analysis and presentation?"
	infrastructure answers the "how" but humanities needs a research program to answer the "what" and "why" -"There exists an important but often-ignored distinction between the research programs that rely on an infrastructure and the research infrastructure itself." (Working together apart 2009) This echos the calls for "grand challenges" what are the big problems in the humanities? Of course isn't this a problematic question? Can any question ever be "solved" in the humanities, seems like there is an epistemological conflict here. Does (cyber)infrastructure, which is in itself a grand notion, imply grand narratives and grand challenges?
