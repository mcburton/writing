"Let me expand on what I mean by “digital humanities.” We use “digital humanities” as an umbrella term for a number of different activities that surround technology and humanities scholarship. Under the digital humanities rubric, I would include topics like open access to materials, intellectual property rights, tool development, digital libraries, data mining, born-digital preservation, multimedia publication, visualization, GIS, digital reconstruction, study of the impact of technology on numerous fields, technology for teaching and learning, sustainability models, and many others." (Bobley 2008 [http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/odhfiles/Why.The.Digital.Humanities.pdf])


Brett Bobley on Digital Humanities vs humanities computing - "seemed to cast a wider net than “humanities computing” which seemed to imply a form of computing, whereas “digital humanities” implied a form of humanism. I also thought it would be an easier sell to the humanities community to have the emphasis on “humanities.”(from Kirschenbaum 2010) It is important that a funding agency has taken a big tent approach to digital humanities rather than either adopt the name humanities computing (and its epistemological commitments) or a computationally focused approach to the digital humanities.




In the first two of his four part series on the digital humanities, Patrick Svensson explores the relation between the humanities and information technology. The articles provide both a deep and broad analysis of the field as a whole, exploring its historical roots in humanities compuing, the discursive shift towards digital humanities, and the ongoing expansion into a multimodel second-wave of "humanities 2.0." 

Svensson notes the "digital humanities comprise a field in a loose sense...an inclusive notion that will allow us to talk about different kinds of initiatives and activities in the intersection between the humanities and information technology or the digital." (Svensson 2009) This is an important observation, for it highlights the digital humanities is more a _conversation_ and a common social object enabling solidarity in a sea of quiddity.

>"at its core, then, digital humanities is more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even technologies....Yet digital humanities is also a social undertaking. It harbors networks of people who have been working together, sharing research, arguing, competing, and collaborating for many years. "(Kirschenbaum 2010)

To claim the digital humanities is merely method cuts off and isolates the social "work" emerging from the the socio-technical edge of the humanities. It ignores the legitimate peripheral participation (cite) of workers and work that has historically been at the margins of the academy (it is also perhaps doubly ironic because humanities computing had been marginalized as well). Digital humanities, as I'll discuss below, has become much more inclusive to participation from those who would not normally be considered traditional academics, both in their practice (multimodal scholars) and in their institutional home (alternative academics).
