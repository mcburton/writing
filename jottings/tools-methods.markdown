# When all you have is a hammer: Tools & Methods


## The Origin Story

When writing and talking about the origin of the digital humanities, we can not and should not ignore the true visionary work of Father Roberto Busa. It was he who had the (divine?) insight in 1949 to contact TK? Watson at IBM to explore the possibilities of their new computation machine in the analysis of text.(Hockey 2004) What resulted was profound for multiple reasons. First, it was an attempt at a complete [lemmatization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatization) of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas, resulting in the Index Thomisticus. Second, Busa's work with IBM demonstrated an entirely new horizon of possibility for humanist practice. Finally, as I explore below, it set a tone both in practice and discourse for the early era of the digital humanities.

The early discovery that computational technology could be brought to bear upon the the analysis of text has set a tone that has carried through the brief history of the digital humanities. Within the pervasive "what is digital humanities" debates, one of the most problematic notions is that the digital humanities is solely focused upon tools, methodology, and text. (McPherson 2009, )
