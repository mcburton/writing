	** Enter "Big Tent" Digital Humanities

	The notion of "Big Tent" humanities emerged from the 2011 Digital Humanities conference at Stanford and was, in my opinion, brought into the wider conciousness by William Pannapacker's articles about his experience at the conference 'Big Tent Digital Humanities,' a View From the Edge, Part 1 and Part 2. 

	"Digital humanities is a comprehensive activist project that uses technology to respond to the interconnected cultural and structural problems of academe." He goes on "It redefines the nature of academic careers while dealing with longstanding disciplinary conversations. And it engages in complex, theoretical heavy lifting while building projects that are often based on the Internet, available to the public, and indisputably useful...Like the founders and builders of museums, libraries, concert halls, and critical editions in the last century, digital humanists are creating the new infrastructure of our history and culture and changing the nature of education and scholarship."



	As Kirschenbaum notes: 
	"Digital humanities has also, I would propose, lately been galvanized by a group of younger (or not so young) graduate students, faculty members (both tenure line and contingent), and other academic professionals who now wield the label “digital humanities” instrumentally amid an increasingly monstrous institutional terrain defined by declining public support for higher education, rising tuitions, shrinking endowments, the proliferation of distance education and the for- profit university, and, underlying it all, the conversion of full- time, tenure- track academic labor to a part- time adjunct workforce."




"at its core, then, digital humanities is more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even technologies....Yet digital humanities is also a social undertaking. It harbors networks of people who have been working together, sharing research, arguing, competing, and collaborating for many years. "(Kirschenbaum 2010) - to claim it is merely method is to cut off and isolate all of the social "work" that has emerged from the intersection of humanities and technology. It ignores the communicative change in favor of the computational change.

"Let me expand on what I mean by “digital humanities.” We use “digital humanities” as an umbrella term for a number of different activities that surround technology and humanities scholarship. Under the digital humanities rubric, I would include topics like open access to materials, intellectual property rights, tool development, digital libraries, data mining, born-digital preservation, multimedia publication, visualization, GIS, digital reconstruction, study of the impact of technology on numerous fields, technology for teaching and learning, sustainability models, and many others." (Bobley 2008 [http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/odhfiles/Why.The.Digital.Humanities.pdf])


Brett Bobley on Digital Humanities vs humanities computing - "seemed to cast a wider net than “humanities computing” which seemed to imply a form of computing, whereas “digital humanities” implied a form of humanism. I also thought it would be an easier sell to the humanities community to have the emphasis on “humanities.”(from Kirschenbaum 2010) It is important that a funding agency has taken a big tent approach to digital humanities rather than either adopt the name humanities computing (and its epistemological commitments) or a computationally focused approach to the digital humanities.


We can think about the digital humanities as a multi-method, multi-modal, interdisciplinary domain focused on studying digital culture in the broadest of terms. Inside of this domain lives specific methodological thrusts, like humanities computing or common sets of research interests like new media studies. 
 


### The Humanist Quadrant

It is perhaps reductionist and categorical, but in light of the current chaos of the disciplines, a quadrant juxtaposing digital methods vs. digital objects is useful as a map.

<!-- <img src="../humanist-quadrant.png" width="1177" height="459"/> -->


The delegation of the so called "traditional humanities" to the lower left square of the quadrant is by no means a minimization of salience. Nor am I seriously implying there is no relation between the traditional humanities and the rest of the square. But this quadrant needs to be here, as an other, because the discussions about humanities computing and the digital humanities often define themselves in relation to a mythical "traditional humanities." Somewhere, a humanist still scours paper archives, jotting down notes on their yellow pad to write up on their typewriter in the form of a 300 page monograph to be mailed to a university press. Obviously, digital methods and objects have leaked into even the most traditional of humanities scholar's practice, but the point remains, humanities computing and the digital humanities see themselves as something distinct and new from the traditional humanities.  

Computational linguistics, computer assisted textual analysis, spatial history, modeling, without computation would be logistically or practically impossible; they are digitally native in the methodological sense. Digitally native methods are those historically associated with humanities computing. Father Busa's Index Thomisticus or Willard McCarty's work "Finding Implicit Patterns in Ovid's Metamorphoses with TACT" (McCarty 1996) would both fit squarely in the upper left quadrant. Now the objects used by humanities computing are obviously digital, but they are also indexical to an analog form. They are models or representations (which one could argue are digitally native) of existing (usually textual) research objects (Unsworth 2002). . This difference is important when considering the distinction between humanities computing and the big tent of the digital humanities.

The bottom right of the quadrant, the use of traditional methods to study digitally native objects, is as I have shown, a newcomer to the big tent. The arrival of this quadrent from domains like new media studies, critical theory and TK was met with some consternation from the humanities computing folks who, with the name change in the oxford companion, had tried to claim the territory for themselves (Svensson 2009).  This community has an uneasy relationship with the monkier "digital humanities." Note a recent faculty search and cluster hire at the University of Michigan was dubbed "digital environments" instead of "digital humanities." Furthermore, those hired study digitally native objects (Spam, Algorithms, Flash media, networks) but do not necessarily deploy digitally native methodologies.  At the same time, communities like HASTAC have very boldly staked their claim, the study of digitally native objects, regardless of methodology, belongs in the big tent digital humanities. 

This leaves the final quadrant in my diagram, the folks who study digitally native objects using digitally native methods. This, curiously, seems to me to be the smallest of the four quadrants. This kind of research, natural language processing of blogs, or spatial analysis of tweets, is common in the social sciences, but this style of work in the humanities is, at least from my perspective, quite uncommon. I suspect, if I were to survey the digital humanities graduate student population I might find more examples of this work, but in the digital humanities today I see very little of it. Where are the computer assisted textual analyses of blogs, or the spatial history of tweets? The interpretivist social sciences are going to be the place to find this work. 


If we can temporarily excuse my earlier comments about science envy, I think the internet is the large hadron collider of the digital humanities.
