What is the argument I want to make?
Well I want to say that there is a need for a research project that does a practice centric ethnography of scholarly publishing in the digital humanities. As Paul Conway has described it, there are two wheels of practice, that of the (digital) humanities scholars and that of the scholarly publishers. The site of intersection between these two wheels is my area of interest. But I am not simply interested in these spinning wheels alone, I want to investigate how technological change throws a wrench between these two wheels (gears?).

I believe that the theories and methods provided by social science, specifically the perspective afforded by situated practice, will shed light on the question of why the practices of scholarly publishing manuscripts in the digital humanities is not adapting to technological change.

The "situated practice" literature is going to need to sharpen its focus. I need to show that it has informed the problem of adapting social practice in the face of new technology. Technomethodology? Suchman? I need to review Ackerman's Gap paper. I should also go through the CSCW journal and conference backlog. look for the term 'adaptation.'    

I need to do the same thing for the communities of practice literature. Is there anything that directly engages change in communities of practice? It might be the case that the organizational routine literature might be _easier_ to bring to bear upon this particular problem. The org routine work specifically address the problem of (n)ever changing. The camp poplar grove is a good example. Practices are replicated, despite their underspecification.

I need to demonstrate that the "situated practice" perspective (which is broadly construed to include ethnomethodological, situated action, communities of practice, org routine) can inform the broad problems of (n)ever change in the face of new technology. 

But before I do that, I need to demonstrate that there is a (n)ever change situation in scholarly publishing. I need to show how in the face of selection pressures from new technology (as well as a host of other sources) the practices of monograph publishing are not changing. 

But before I do that, I need to demonstrate that there is a technological (r)evolution happening in scholarly publishing. To do this I will use a specific case, the digital humanities and how their changing practices are imposing pressure upon the scholarly publishers.
