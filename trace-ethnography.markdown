# Trace Ethnography

The purpose of this document is to identify the theoretical assumptions of trace ethnography and to identify the problem space where it was effective. 

Briefly, trace ethnography is a term and methodological technique introduced by Geiger & Ribes in their article "The Work of Sustaining Order in Wikipedia:  The Banning of a Vandal." In the article, Geiger & Ribes investigated the role of software tools in the automation & augmentation of anti-vandalism activities on wikipedia. Their qualitative research unpacked an intricate network of human and non-human actors who work in concert to battle the onslaught of vandals who potentially contaminate wikipedia.

The study found the software agents, or "bots," are more than simply a force-multiplier increasing the efficiency of anti-vandal activities. These software agents are constitutive elements of the socio-technical fabric of wikipedia enabling highly distributed and coordinated efforts to fight vandalism. While this is interesting, what is more important to this discussion is the role trace ethnography  played in helping them render visible the intricate socio-technical fabric. Through an ethnography orientation to documentary "traces" the normally invisible work of "banning a vandal" was revealed. "The method is best for revealing the often invisible infrastructure that underlie routinized activities, allowing researchers to generate highly-empirical accounts of network-level phenomena without having to be present at every node." (Geiger & Ribes 200)

In the following I wish to "trace" the relationship between the practical methodology to its theoretical underpinnings. Then I will begin to explore how trace ethnography as method and accompanying theoretical assumptions might be brought to bare upon the intersection of scholarly publishing and the digital humanities.
 

## Practical Method Description

The practical purpose of trace ethnography is to "reconstruct the patterns and practices of users in distributed sociotechnical systems." (Geiger & Ribes 2011) In the paper that introduced the methodology, Geiger & Ribes reconstructed patterns of vandal and anti-vandal activity on Wikipedia through the historical records kept by the MediaWiki software. These logs, which record not only document changes, but usernames and IP addresses. Through this user metadata wikipedia editors, and the academic observers, were able to reconstruct the situated and sequential activities.

Trace ethnography has two fundamental principles, first "documentary traces abound in today's technological systems" and second, "documentary traces are the primary mechanism in which users themselves know their distributed communities and act within them." 

### Documentary Traces Abound

Takes advantage of the "informating" properties of digital technology. Informatiacorns coined by soshana zuboff in her book "in the age of the smart machine" 1989? to describe a particular feature of digital information technology as opposed to mechanical technology. "The devices that automate by translating information into action also register data about those automated activities, thus generating new streams of information." (Zuboff 1988) Not only does digital information technology allow the processing of information with unprecedented ease, it can also produce logs or metadata about that processing with equal ease. As Zuboff showed, the "informated" metadata, such as transaction, access, or activity logs, renders visible entirely new facets of an organization. This visibility has serious implications with regards to power and agency within organizational hierarchies. "The same systems that make it possible to automate office transactions also create a vast overview of an organization's operations, with many levels of data coordinated and accessible for a variety of analytical efforts" (Zuboff)

In large scale distributed organizations, especially online communities where traditional hierarchies do not regulate the flow of information, such as Wikipedia, these traces are vital resources. Informated traces are the primary, and sometimes only, mechanism through which members are able to know and act within the distributed constituency.

### Mediated Discursive Practice in Documentary Traces 

In online communities, the historical records of member's activities, their traces, are the only discursive formation available. Members of highly distributed online communities assemble by and through the mediation of digital communicative infrastructure. In many cases the documentary traces are, in essence, "all they have to go on." For example, as Geiger & Ribies showed wikipedia editors used the edit histories of wikipedia entries in the course of a disciplinary hearing about editorial decisions.  

Trace ethnography follows  the documentary residue of our activity online. These traces might include such things as "transaction logs, version histories, institutional records, conversation transcripts, and source code."  By re-assembling these traces a researcher can gain a much richer understanding of how networks of people assemble and operate online.  "Once decoded, sets of such documentary traces can then be assembled into rich narratives of interaction, allowing researchers to carefully follow coordination practices, information flows, situated routines, and other social and organizational phenomena across a variety of scales." (Geiger & Ribes 2011)

It is also important to note, many communities assemble online and face to face, for example wikipedia's many meet-ups and conferences. What is important to recognize is many "virtual" communities assemble in both online and offline environments and as such we need methodologies to engage both discursive spaces. Hence, trace ethnography paired with traditional ethnography allows researchers to gain a richer understanding of the discursive formation in both environments.


## Theoretical Underpinnings

In this section I will begin to unpack the theoretical underpinnings of trace ethnography. 

They take seriously the notion of turning people ('ethno') into writing ('graphy'). There is a practical and theoretical challenge however, what constitutes "people." In

### Science Studies
Latour - "chains of association," "circulating reference," "Delegation," and the relocation of agency within/across a network of human and non-human actors (ANT).

While Geiger & Ribes cite Latour's "circulating reference" it was unclear to me how it was being used analytically. They also deployed to Latour's "Chains of Association" to help explain how actors themselves assemble documentary traces in order to reconstitute historical activities, such as the disciplinary hearing. These actor assembled traces are extremely important analytically, researchers should pay careful attention to how these traces are utilized within actor's situated discursive practice to accomplish social "work." As Geiger & Ribes put it "One reason why [pre-assembled] documentary traces are so useful is that they are produced and circulated in a specific sociotechnical environment, embedded with local meaning.  While it is tempting to think of such data as ancillary, kept simply because computer systems log data, they are often used by members themselves to render accountable a number of social and organizational practices" (Geiger & Ribes 2011)

Bowker & Star - Infrastructural Inversion, Ethnography of Infrastructure
the "trace" is by its vary nature an invisible element of the networked configuration. They are only revealed during inversion processes, either instigated by the analyze or by specific events such as a disciplinary hearing. 

The practice of infrastructural inversion is part of a conscious analytical effort to illuminate what otherwise might be invisible, yet never-the-less integral, elements of a socio-technical system. The concept originates from Bowker's studies of scientific

###  Distributed Cognition

The idea of distributed cognition was introduced by Ed Hutchins to help understand how complex tasks, such as the collaborative work of keeping a U.S. Navy ship on course. Contrary to psychological perspective that posits cognition occurs exclusively inside the heads of individuals, Hutchins argues that cognition is distributed within the environment and is thus "directly observable" to the social network. Thus, complex and coordinated cognition is distributed in and through objects and inscriptions like navigational charts and  physical markers on instruments.

In the banning of a vandal, software tools and edit logs augment the activity of wikipedia editors. Like the navigation of a ship, the maintainence of wikipedia is an extremely complicated and informationally demanding activity requiring editors to collectively sort through massive amounts of information (informated edit logs) to determine when to revert an edit or ban an individual from making further edits. Technical actors such as the software tools, like the

## Applicable Theoretical Themes

### Infrastructure Studies

Ethnography of publishing infrastructure for the digital humanities. Can we treat cyberinfrastructure for the production and dissemination of knowledge in the digital humanities as an object of study? What might an "infrastructural inversion" of this object look like? 

One vantage point's invisible trace is another vantage point's whole world. 

one example from such an inversion might be:
From the perspective of formal scholarly publishing blogging and tweeting are "traces" of scholar's discursive practice. Would an inversion reveal any insight into the relationship between the invisible college and formally published scholarship? 

Would reveal certain assumptions being built into the infrastructure which is currently being designed.  

"When is infrastructgure" - digital humanities is currently "infrastructuring" they are in the midst of forming their standards and classifications. They are currently in the processes of making boundaries and structures. 

Infrastructural inversion looks at the recursive structural formations, embodied in standards, classifications, technical apparatus, habits & routines. 

Is the digital humanities, by rattling the cage of scholarly publishing performing a sort of actor's infrastructural inversion? 


### ANT 

With agency diffuse throughout a network of human and non-human actors, we can begin to tease out how the configuration resists technological change.

### Recursive Publics

Is the digital humanities a "recursive public" as defined in Kelty's book "Two Bits"

A key element of any infrastructure, as defined by Bowker & Star, is the recursivity of its constituent parts. 

The idea of recusion is deployed similarly by both Kelty and by Bowker & Star. 

While the idea of "recursive public" is not directly referenced in trace ethnography method, there is some thematic overlap. I believe the concept and this method could be productively paired together.
