* Grey Literature and Scholarly Communication





** Visibility 

"Whatever else it might be then, the digital humanities today is about a scholarship (and a pedagogy) that is publicly visible in ways to which we are generally unaccustomed, a scholarship and pedagogy that are bound up with infrastructure in ways that are deeper and more explicit than we are generally accustomed to, a scholarship and pedagogy that are collaborative and depend on networks of people and that live an active 24/7 life online."


*** Blogs
	Within the (digital) humanities blogs occupy this strange space 

*** Twitter
	No serious inspection of the digital humanities could be complete without some consideration of the role twitter has formed in the late formation of digital humanities as a community of practice / epistemic culture. 
	
Just today as I am writing these words @brettbobley tweets "Welcome William @pannapacker of the Chronicle to Twitter." to which @pannapacker responds "@brettbobley Thank you, Brett."
