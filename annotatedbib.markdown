### Humanities Scholarship in the Digital Age

1.  Borgman, C. L. 2009. "The digital future is now: A call to action for the humanities." Digital Humanities Quarterly 3(4) (http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000077/000077.html).
	- She defines DH as "digital humanities is a new set of practices, using new sets of technologies, to address research problems of the discipline"
	- Digital humanities has a lot of catching up to do with the sciences, infrastructure is lacking.
	- DH infrastructure needs those who do DH, not just developers, to build out infrastructure.
	- "The reasons for the slow adoption of digital publishing in the humanities are many, from not trusting online dissemination to a general reluctance to experiment with new technologies, even those well proven — "professionally indisposed to change" as Ken Hamma puts it [Hamma 2009]"
	- "Monographic publishing, which is core to humanities scholarship, has begun a seismic shift toward digital publishing [Jaschik 2008]; [Jaschik 2009]; [Poe 2001]; [Willinsky 2006]; [Willinsky 2009]. "
	- Digital publishing in the sciences has afforded wider access to scholarship. It seems that Borgman conflates digital publishing with open access (or at least only very briefly engages the difference in paragraph 18) when she talks about increased citation rates for digital publication. There is more nuance she could have gone into here, but chose not to. I find this interesting.
	- She goes on to talk about about technological impact with humanities Data, Research Methods, Collaboration, Incentives, and learning. 
	- Call to acton for Digital humanities:
		- What are Data?
		- What are the infrastructure requirements?
		- Where are the social studies of digital humanities?
		- What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century?
		- What is the value proposition for digital humanities in the era of declining budgets?
	- The shape of these questions implies, to me at least, that Borgman wants the humanities to become more like the sciences. For got and for bad, concepts like "data", "laboratory" are very science centic and make me wonder if they are potentially mutually exclusive to a humanitarian epistemology. At the same time, I complete agree that we need more social studies of digital humanities (exemplified by this projet). The call for infrastructure also appeals to the builder in me, and I agree there needs to be serious effort to tease out the potential difference between scientific and humanities infrastructure. This relates to the value proposition, which is very complicated. From a funding of infrastructure perspective, do we pay for a cathedral or a bizarre (in the eric raymond sense)? What happens if we fund the wrong cathedral? I think there needs to be some fecundity, but there also needs to be a common platform that evolves to support the fecund boutique projects.

	- the slow adoption of multimedia technology is a result from a lack of understanding "work"
	- this slow adoption is creating a humanities version of "technological obsolescence." the use of the term obsolete is interesting. It is a very strong word, stronger than I would use myself, but I think it characterizes the extent to which these authors, and Fitzpatrick believe that the fight over form, modality, and materiality of humanist know production is a fight for survival.
	- "scholarly multimedia threatens the very coherence of humanities scholarship by insisting on the re-embodiment of scholarly activity. "
	- methods (digital humanities, humanities computing) vs objects (new media studies)
	- "By scholarly multimedia we specifically mean critical scholarly works — interpretive and argumentative, as opposed to creative or archival — that are produced, and in some cases performed, in multimedia form."
	- "embodied labor, more narrowly, we mean the physical actions (often disciplined by machinic interactions) that go into interacting with machines"
	-implications of the 'radical sameness' argument: "If multimedia is regarded as no different from other scholarly forms, the complex labor practices and new knowledges required to produce scholarly works of multimedia, such as interface design, coding, video production, hardware support, institutional interactions and so on, may be devalued to the extent that they are seen more as service (akin to maintaining a department's computer lab or website) or not seen as meaningful scholarly activity at all."
	- Hayles argument about how the knowledge is not separate from the materiality which constitutes it: "he materiality of multimedia scholarship is constantly under erasure insofar as we imagine that the heart of any scholarly work (the intellectual part) is purely "informational," as if, like Athena, it springs forth from the scholar's mind and takes up residency inside the book or article or machine. Hayles, drawing on Richard Doyle, calls it an "impossible inversion," where the informational pattern or code is imagined as actually producing the thing on which the pattern nonetheless depends [Hayles 1999b, 293]."
	- the article ends abruptly with this point "The multimedia scholar, by taking seriously the materiality of knowledge production, embodies an intellectual identity that is dispersed over material, rhetorical, and technical networks — a crucial transformation that must be acknowledged when assessing "what counts" as scholarly activity in the academy." There is a nice, but not fully developed point that multimedia is challenging an invisible assumption that we are all, as latour says, "minds in a vat" and that there is a clean separation between the intellectual essence and the material, rhetorical, and technical realities of our scholarly output. I think I might be able to re-organize their argument here in terms of organizational routines. In a sense, being a multi-media scholar requires an engagement above and beyond "the way it has been done before." Writing a monograph or journal article _does_ have a set of material, rhetorical, and technological realities, but our attentiveness to them, our performative practices, are deeply embodied in the habits and routines of scholars that we are, collectively, no longer cognizant of those performances. This "work" has faded into the invisible and assumed background expectancies, an invisible background frame used to render visible new work. Multimedia scholarship pulls those habits, routines and background expectencies into the light and problematizes them alongside the "intellectual essence" that normally counts as "visible work"

## Work Practice

### Ethnomethodology & Situated Practice

	* This is the conference version of "On Technomethodology."  See notes below.
	* "The paradox of technomethodology lies in the attempt to design novel technological solutions based on an analytical perspective with a specific orientation towards the existing detail of practical action."
	* "rather than have systems design and ethnomethodology ‘reach' towards each other and ‘meet' at a design, we instead look to forge more foundational relationships, and then approach design from a new position. This foundational relationship is one in which design adopts the analytic mentality of ethnomethodology, and ethnomethodology dons the practical mantle of design. "
	* Three ways EM interact with Design
		1. *Learning from ethnomethodologists.* This category refers to organization of the ethnomethodology-design relationship through the active involvement of an  ethnomethodological researcher in the design process. 
		2. *Learning from ethnomethodological accounts.* This category refers to organization of the ethnomethodology-design relationship through use of ethnomethodological accounts, or written field reports and analyses of work. 
		3. *Learning from ethnomethodology.* This category refers to organization of the ethnomethodology-design relationship through the exploration of foundationalethnomethodological principles and insights. - _technomethodology_

1.  Crabtree, A. 2004. “Taking technomethodology seriously: hybrid change in the ethnomethodology–design relationship.” European Journal of Information Systems 13(3):195–209. (http://www.mrl.nott.ac.uk/~axc/documents/papers/EJIS04.pdf)
	* revisiting Technomethodology, operationalizing it.
	* "a socio-technical model of design that exploits the ethnomethodological notions of ‘breaching experiments' and consulting ‘perspicuous settings' to propel innovation in design. This model operationalises Button and Dourish's third way – i.e., it moves technomethodology on from reflecting on EM principles and insights to exploiting and developing them for the practical purposes of IT research. "
	* First Crabtree takes us into the philosophy of Husserl and the distinction between science, which never questions the possibility of objective truth vs philosophy which does. 
	* "Husserl is not denying objective knowledge and the achievements of the sciences – he is not entertaining the Sceptic or the Relativist - but asking what makes the transcendent achievements of the sciences possible?"
	* "The problem that Husserl has with this state of affairs is not the validity status of objective knowledge (again, that is for a community of practitioners to determine) but that the practical observability and practical objectivity of the objects of science is divorced from the “vital practices” whereby formal methods are made to work (ibid.). The practical observability and practical objectivity of the objects of the sciences is attributed to their formal workings instead. Thus, there is a foundational gap in our knowledge regarding the relation between knowing and the known object. A gap that consists of but ignores the vital (in the sense of being alive, enacted and essential) practices that provide for the production of objective knowledge: “the sources of knowing”, in Husserl's words (1999, Lecture IV).   "
	* Crabtree gives a nice explaination of the "pulsar paper" by Garfinkel, Lynch, and Livingston. He explains they show 5 things
	1. Their work "realized a plan in real time" but the "lived orderliness" was not dictated by the plan. The plan being in this case the ways by which they constructed the 
	2. "accountable object" - the pulsar is a real thing, but it transitioned from a "vague object-of-sorts" to a verifiable "object-that-is-actually-out-there-in-the-world" through the scientists sequences of talk.
	3. While it is not simply talk that constituted the reality of the object, it _is_ the talk that made the "observable structure of work" this the work made _visible_ which is a requirement for the mutual recognition of the object-that-is-actually-out-there-in-the-world.
	4. This visible and accountable work is by definition "according to plan" but it is _really_ constituted by the "reflexively produced and locally organized in and through concerted social interaction or cooperative work." But all of this is stripped away and we are left only with formal methods and discriptions.
	5. The object is constituted by and through the competence of the locally situated actors. Objects come to exist _for human beings_ as a result of human practice.
	* " This is not to say that such things as pulsars only exist as a result of human practice - that human practice casts and recasts the real world of things concrete. Rather, it is draw attention to what we already know but too often forget, namely that the real world of things concrete only exists for human beings as a result of human practice, and as practice changes so does our understanding of the real world of things concrete."
	* If knowledge is inextricably tied up with the practices that constitute that knowledge, then any attempt to change those practices potentially threatens the validity of the knowledge produced. There is no clean separation between practice and knowledge for the production and validation/verification of said knowledge is deeply situated. This is why a change in the technological practices of humanist knowledge projection is so paradoxical. How we come to "know" humanistic things is inter wined with how they are presented.
	* hybrid-program - takes the Ethnomethodological approach, which assumes the existence of a "missing interactional what" and foregrounds that work as the phenomenal object, as the things we study and the things we learn. "intention of the hybrid programme is clear: it is to inform the ongoing professional development of occupational practices whose workaday objects are under ‘praxiological' study (Garfinkel 1996)."
	* where the earlier Technomethodology article dug into the EM concept of "accounts" and advocated a design discipline that borrowed concepts from EM, this article takes more seriously the reality of that work which is _not_ accounted for and calls for it to be the central focus of the hybrid-discipline. Crabtree is going further than Dourish and Button in that he is asserting the "missing interactional what's" ontological reality, rather than analytically.
	* breaching experiments - "treating novel technical implementations as potter's objects, breaching experiments become both a means and resource providing for the exploration of potential technical futures through the explication of accountable structures of practical action made visible in the intertwining of people and computers." new technological objects, like art, reveal our assumptions. This is already happening in the humanities, "digital humanities" is like a big Garfinkelian breaching experiment envisioning a the future and pointing out that the emperor has no clothes. The question however is not how to learn to "see" but how can we change the underlying assumptions?
	* Crabtree uses the example of the Distributed Legible City installation that let people bike around "cities" in a virtual space. What he highlights through the conversations around the installation was that people invoked the "common background expectancies" of the city in the course of their conversations. They talked simply as if they were navigating around a city, not some strange virtual world made up of text. This was the "_scheme of interpretation_" deployed. "DLC was nevertheless oriented to by members of the public as a real world arrangement of urban space."
	* "the aim [of breaching experiments] is to explore the sociality of novel design spaces opened up through the deployment of novel technology configurations in real world situations of use." Digital humanities has breaching experiments in spades.
	* "design->real-world-deployment/breaching-experiment->study-of-perspicuous-setting->design" iterative process, ethnomethodology has come to play an active and constructive role in IT research, not by specifying requirements but by providing techniques and resources to explore and reason about the sociality of the design space."
	* "technology becomes a vehicle for social research, the results of which in turn propel innovation through technological exploration of social phenomenon initially seen in the breach and subsequently fleshed out through the consultation of perspicuous settings. " This seems to advocate a kind of "build it and see what happens" attitude, this had been tried before in DH. the key distinction here is that how you "see what happens" is very different. The participants must accept the EM assumptions about the "missing what" if they are going to extract any value from this kind of experiment. This begs a research question, does the "build it and see what happens" experiment bear fruit if it is conducted by EM informed folks vs non-EM folks? I.E. this with the proper professional vision. That seems to be what Crabtree is arguing here.
	* 	The Technomethodology method as described by Crabtree:
		1. Let designers build whatever they want with whomever they want, subject to their own constraints.
		2. Deploy the objects of design in real world settings.
		3. Treat deployment as a breaching experiment.
		4. Explicate the accountable structures of practical action made visible in the breach.
		5. Explore the topics identified in the breach through the study of perspicuous settings.
		6. Use the studies of perspicuous settings to flesh out abstract design concepts.
		7. Deploy the new design solution in real world settings and study its use.
		8. Repeat the process until the research agenda has been satisfied for all practical purposes.

	* "This approach takes as its starting point a relationship between ethnomethodology and system design which is a foundational, theoretical matter rather than simply one of design practice and process. From this foundation, we believe, emerges a new model of interaction with computer systems which is based on ethnomethodological perspectives on everyday human social action."

	* Fundamental challenge is how to meld Ethnomethodology with Design (namely system design)
	* three ways to inform design
		* "Learning from Ethnomethodologists" - no explicit EM. rather there is an ethno on the team who mediates between on-the-ground and the designers
		* "Learning from Ethnomethodological Accounts" - designers draw from EM accounts, written, of local situated practice. These accounts are input into design processes.

		* "the paradox of system design—that the introduction of technology designed to support “large-scale” ac-tivities while fundamentally transforming the “small-scale” detail of action can systematically un-dermine exactly the detailed features of working practice through which the “large-scale” activity is, in fact, accomplished. It points, fundamentally, to the interdependence of minute practice and grand accomplishment."
		* "the paradox of technomethodology. Given the concern with the particular, with detail, and with the moment-by-moment organisation of action, how can ethnomethodology be applied to the design of new tech-nologies?"
		* Technomethodological approach, reconsiders fundamental design principles through the lens of EM
			* Use the example of EM accounts as a way by which EM principles can be applied to system design. How can designers build systems which can account for its actions? Rendering visible certain activities while obscuring others behind abstractions.
	* CS abstractions are generative; are used in the manipulation of systems
	* EM abstractions are analytic; are in opposition to abstract "ideal types" from traditional sociology.
	* "Cohort Independence" - from Garfinkel & Sacks, "social phenomena that are not tied to the scenic features of their production" behaviors or patterns of behavior that transcend race, culture, occupational identity. they transcend "ideal types" and as such make those sociological abstractions less useful analytically. Focuses on everyday behavior not sociological generalizations.
	*  "technomethodology attempts to align system design not so much with the details of specific working practices, as with the details of the means by which such working practices arise and are constituted."
